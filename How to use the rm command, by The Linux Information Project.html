<p>
The <i>rm</i> (i.e., <i>remove</i>) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is used to delete files and directories on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> and other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating systems</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The general syntax for rm is: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rm [options] [-r directories] filenames </code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The items in square brackets are optional. When used just with the names
 of one or more files, rm deletes all those files without requiring 
confirmation by the user. Thus, in the following example, rm would 
immediately delete the files named <i>file1</i>, <i>file2</i> and <i>file3</i>, assuming that all three are located in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html">current directory</a> (i.e., the directory in which the user is currently working):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rm file1 file2 file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Error messages are returned if a file does not exist or if the user does
 not have the appropriate permission to delete it. Write-protected files
 prompt the user for a confirmation (with a <i>y</i> for <i>yes</i> and an <i>n</i> for <i>no</i>)
 before removal. Files located in write-protected directories can never 
be removed, even if those files are not write-protected. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>-f</i> (i.e., <i>force</i>) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">option</a>
 tells rm to remove all specified files, whether write-protected or not,
 without prompting the user. It does not display an error message or 
return error status if a specified file does not exist.  However, if an 
attempt is made to remove files in a write-protected directory, this 
option will not suppress an error message.
</p>

<p>
The <i>-i</i>  (i.e., <i>interactive</i>) option tells rm to prompt the 
user for confirmation before removing each file and directory. If both 
the -f and -i options are specified, the last one specified takes 
affect.
</p>

<p>
As a safety measure, rm does not delete directories by default. In order to delete directories, it is necessary to use the <i>-r</i> option, which is the same as the <i>-R</i> option. This option <i>recursively</i> removes directories and their contents in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html">argument</a>
 list; that is, the specified directories will first be emptied of any 
subdirectories (including their subdirectories and files, etc.) and 
files and then removed. The user is normally prompted for removal of any
 write-protected files in the directories unless the -f option is used. 
</p>

<p>
If a file encountered by rm is a symbolic link, the link is removed, but
 the file or directory to which that link refers will not be affected. A
 user does not need write permission to delete a symbolic link, as long 
as the user has write permission for the directory in which that link 
resides.
</p>

<p>
The rm command supports the -- (two consecutive dashes) parameter as a 
delimiter that indicates the end of the options. This is useful when the
 name of a file or directory begins with a dash or hyphen. For example, 
the following removes a directory named <i>-dir1</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rm -r -- -dir1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Other options include <i>-v</i> (i.e., <i>verbose</i>), which provides additional information about what is happening, <i>--help</i>, which provides basic documentation about rm, and <i>--version</i>,
 which tells the version of rm that is currently in use. Some 
differences exist among the various versions of rm, so it is always wise
 to read the documentation for the particular system. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>rmdir</i> command differs from rm in that it is only used to remove empty directories.
