<p> 
A <i>hard link</i> is merely an additional name for an existing <a href="http://www.linfo.org/file.html">file</a> on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> or other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_system.html">operating systems</a>.
</p>

<p>
Any number of hard links, and thus any number of names, can be created 
for any file. Hard links can also be created to other hard links. 
However, they cannot be created for <a href="http://www.linfo.org/directory.html">directories</a>, and they cannot cross <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filesystem.html">filesystem</a> boundaries or span across <a href="http://www.linfo.org/partition.html">partitions</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The operating system makes no distinction between the name that was 
originally assigned to a file when it was first created and any hard 
links that are subsequently created to that file other than that they 
are merely multiple names for the same file. This is because the 
original name and any hard links all point to the same <a href="http://www.linfo.org/inode.html"><i>inode</i></a>. An inode is a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/data_structure.html"><i>data structure</i></a> (i.e., an optimized way of storing <a href="http://www.linfo.org/information.html">information</a>) that stores all the information about a file (e.g., its size, its <a href="http://www.linfo.org/permissions.html">access permissions</a>, when it was created and where it is located on the system) except its name(s) and its actual <a href="http://www.linfo.org/data.html">data</a>.
 The fact that inode numbers are unique only within any filesystem is 
the reason that they do not work across filesystems and partitions.
</p>


<p>
Hard links are created with the <i>ln</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a>. For example, the following would create a hard link named <i>hlink1</i> to a file named <i>file1</i>, both in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html">current directory</a> (i.e., the directory in which the user is currently working):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ln file1 hlink1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When a hard link is created, there is no obvious indication that it is 
any different from any other file. That is, hard links appear to be 
files of the same type as their <i>target</i> files (i.e., the files to which they are linked) when they are viewed with commands such as <i>ls</i> (i.e., <i>list</i>) and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/file_command.html"><i>file</i></a> (which is used to determine the type of any specified files). Likewise, when viewed in a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gui.html">GUI</a> (graphical user interface), the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/icons.html">icons</a> for hard links are identical to those for their target files.
</p>

<p>
That the initial name of a file and all hard links to that file all 
share the same inode can be clearly seen by using the ls command with 
its <i>-i</i> (i.e., <i>inode</i>) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">option</a>. Thus, for example, the following would show that the inode numbers of file1 and hlink1 from the above example are identical:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls -i file1 hlink1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The number of hard links to any file is shown in the second column of output produced by using ls with its <i>-l</i> (i.e., <i>long</i>)
 option. It can be seen that the number is the sum of the target file 
and any hard links to it (i.e., the sum of the initial name and any 
subsequently added names) and that it is the same for the target and for
 each such link.
</p>

<p>
Hard linked files can also be found by using the <i>find</i> command with its <i>-type f</i> option (to select only regular files) followed by its <i>-links +1</i> option (to show all regular files with more than one hard link to them) as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>find -type f -links +1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When a change is made to the contents of a file, the linkage to all of the hard links is preserved. However, some <a href="http://www.linfo.org/text_editors.html">text editors</a> may break the link by creating a new inode for the revised contents,<font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font> and thus it can be prudent to check important links after modifying files.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.linfo.org/rm.html"><i>rm</i></a> command superficially appears to <i>remove</i> or <i>delete</i>
 files. What it really does, however, is to reduce a file's hard link 
count (i.e., the number of names the file has) by one, and it does not 
directly affect the inode or the file's data. When the count reaches 
zero, the file appears to have vanished because there is no longer any 
easy way to reference it. However, the file's data is only truly deleted
 when the location(s) on the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/hdd.html">hard disk drive</a> (HDD) or other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/storage.html">storage</a> media that contains it is overwritten by a new file.
</p>

<p>
Thus, for example, the following would remove the hard link hlink1 that was created in the above example:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rm hlink1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Using rm again with the one remaining name as follows would then make the file's data virtually inaccessible:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rm file1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Perhaps the most useful application for hard links is to allow files, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">programs</a> and scripts (i.e. short programs) to be easily accessed in a different directory from the original file or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/executable.html">executable file</a>
 (i.e., the ready-to-run version of a program). Typing the name of the 
hard link will cause the program or script to be executed in the same 
way as using its original name. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Symbolic links</i>, also called <i>soft links</i>, are more useful 
than hard links because they can be made to directories as well as to 
files on different filesystems and on different partitions. Moreover, 
when using a GUI, symbolic links have special icons that immediately 
identify them as being links rather than ordinary files. However, they 
have the disadvantage that they become unusable if their target file is 
deleted.
</p>

<p>
<i>Aliases</i> superficially resemble hard links in that they are 
another way of providing multiple names for any file. However, the alias
 command is built into the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/shell.html">shell</a> (i.e., the program that provides the text-only <a href="http://www.linfo.org/user_interface.html">user interface</a>)
 rather than being a separate program and the mechanism is very 
different from that of hard links. Like symbolic links, aliases can be 
used not only for files but also for directories and can cross 
filesystem and partition boundaries. In addition, an alias can be used 
as a short name for any <i>shell text</i> (i.e., a command or series of linked commands, inclusive of tbeir options and/or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/arguments.html">arguments</a>).

<br>
<font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font>Tests on Red Hat Linux 9 found that hard links were broken when modifying files using the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gedit.html"><i>gedit</i></a> text editor. However, they were not broken when using the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/vi/index.html">vi</a> and Abiword text editors as well as the KHexEdit <a href="http://www.linfo.org/hex_editor.html">hex editor</a>
 on the same version of Linux. The failure of gedit to preserve hard 
links was due to the fact that it actually creates a copy of the 
modified file that it saves (and thus the new inode number) rather than 
making the changes to the original file, but this copy is given the name
 of the original file. However, a similar test using a newer version of 
gedit (2.14.0) on Fedora Core 5 showed that the problem had been 
corrected and that there was no breakage of links.
