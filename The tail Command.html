<p>
The <i>tail</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> reads the final few lines of any text given to it as an input and writes them to <a href="http://www.linfo.org/standard_output.html"><i>standard output</i></a> (which, by default, is the monitor screen).
</p>

<p>
The basic syntax for tail is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail [options] [filenames]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The square brackets indicate that the enclosed items are optional. By 
default, tail returns the final ten lines of each file name that is 
provided to it. 
</p>

<p>
For example, the following command will <i>print</i> (traditional Unix terminology for <i>write</i>) the last ten lines of the file named <i>aardvark</i> in the <i>current directory</i> (i.e., the director in which the user is currently working) to the display screen:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail aardvark</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If more than one input file is provided, tail will print the last ten 
lines from each file to the monitor screen. Each set of lines will be 
preceded by the name of the file and separated by one vertical space 
from other sets of lines. The following is an example of using tail with
 multiple input files: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail aardvark anteater armadillo</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If it is desired to print some number of lines other than the default ten, the <i>-n</i>
 option can be used followed by an integer indicating the number of 
lines desired. For example, to print the final 15 lines from each file 
in the above example, the command would be modified as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail -n15 aardvark anteater armadillo</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
-n is a very tolerant option. For example, it is not necessary for the 
integer to directly follow it without a space in between. Thus, the 
following command would produce the same result:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail -n &nbsp;  15 aardvark anteater armadillo</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In fact, the letter <i>n</i> does not even need to be used at all. Just 
the hyphen and the integer (with no intervening space) are sufficient to
 tell tail how many lines to print. Thus, the following would produce 
the same result as the above commands:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail -15 aardvark anteater armadillo</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
tail can also print any desired number of <i>bytes</i> (i.e., a sequence of eight <a href="http://www.linfo.org/bit.html">bits</a> and usually long enough to represent a single <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">character</a>) from the end of each file rather than a desired number of lines. This is accomplished using the <i>-c</i>
 option followed by the number of bytes desired. For example, to view 
the final five bytes of each of the two files aardvark and anteater, the
 following command would be used: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail -c 5 aardvark anteater</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When tail counts by bytes, it also includes the <i>newline character</i>, which is a <i>non-printing</i> (i.e, invisible) character that is designated by a backward slash and the letter <i>n</i> (i.e., <i>\n</i>).
 Thus, for example, if there are three new, blank lines at the end of a 
file, they will be counted as three characters, along with the <i>printing</i> characters (i.e., characters that are visible on the monitor screen or paper).
</p>

<p>
The number of bytes or lines can be followed by a multiplier suffix. That is, adding the letter <i>b</i> directly after the number of bytes multiplies it by 512, <i>k</i> multiplies it by 1024 and <i>m</i> multiplies it by 1048576. Thus, the following command would print the last five kilobytes of the file aardvark:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail -c5k aardvark</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The -c option is less tolerant than the -n option. That is, there is no 
default number of bytes, and thus some integer must be supplied. Also, 
the letter <i>c</i> cannot be omitted as can the letter <i>n</i>, 
because in such case tail would interpret the hyphen and integer 
combination as the -n option. Thus, for example, the following would 
produce an error message something like <i>tail: aardvark: invalid number of bytes</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail -c aardvark</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If tail is used without any options or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>arguments</i></a>
 (i.e., inputs), it will await input from the keyboard and will 
successively repeat (i.e., each line will appear twice) on the monitor 
screen each of the final ten lines typed on the keyboard. If it were 
desired to repeat some number of lines other than the default ten, then 
the -n option would be used followed by the integer representing that 
number of lines (although, again, it is not necessary to include the 
letter <i>n</i>), e.g.,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail -n3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As is the case with other <i>command line</i> (i.e., all-text mode) programs in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating systems</a>, the output of tail can be <a href="http://www.linfo.org/redirection.html"><i>redirected</i></a> from the monitor to a file or printer using the <i>redirection operator</i>
 (which is represented by a rightward pointing angular bracket). For 
example, the following would write the final 12 lines of the file <i>Yuriko</i> to the file <i>December</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail -n 12 Yuriko &gt; December</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the file named December did not yet exist, the redirection operator 
would create it; if it already existed, the redirection operator would 
overwrite it. To avoid erasing data on an existing file, the <i>append operator</i>
 (which is represented by two rightward pointing angular brackets) could
 be used to add the output from tail to the end of a file with that name
 if it already existed (or otherwise create a new file with that name), 
i.e.,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail -n 12 Yuriko &gt;&gt; December</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The output from other commands can be <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pipes.html"><i>piped</i></a> (i.e., sent) to tail to use as its input. For example, the following sends the output from the <i>ls</i>
 command (which by default lists the names of the files and directories 
in the current directory) to tail, which, in turn, prints the final ten 
lines of the output that it receives from ls to the monitor screen:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls | tail</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This output could easily be redirected, for example to a file named <i>last_filenames</i> as follows: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls | tail &gt;&gt; last_filenames</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It could also be piped to one or more filters for additional processing. For example, the <i>sort</i> filter could be used with its <i>-r</i> option to sort the output in reverse <a href="http://www.linfo.org/alphabet.html">alphabet</a>ic order prior to writing to a file: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls | tail | sort -r &gt;&gt; last_filenames</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>-q</i> (i.e., <i>quiet</i>) option causes tail to not print the 
file name before each set of lines and to eliminate the vertical space 
between each set of lines when there are multiple input sources. The <i>-v</i> (i.e., <i>verbose</i>) option causes tail to print the file name even if there is just a single input file. 
</p>

<p>
Tail could be viewed as a counterpart of the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/head.html"><i>head</i></a>
 command, which always starts reading from the beginning of files and 
which can continue until any specified distance from the beginning. 
However, there are a few differences. Perhaps the most useful of these 
is that tail is somewhat more flexible in that, in addition to being 
able to start reading any specified distance from the end of a file, it 
can also start at any specified distance from the beginning of a file. 
</p>

<p>
Tail can be instructed to begin printing from some number of lines or 
bytes from the start of a file by preceding the number with a plus sign 
instead of a minus sign. For example, the following would print each of 
the designated files to the display monitor beginning with the seventh 
line and until the end:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail +7 aardvark anteater armadillo</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The c option could be used to tell tail to print each of the designated 
files beginning with the seventh byte instead of the seventh line:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail +7c aardvark anteater armadillo</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A particularly common application for tail is examining the most recent 
entries in log files. This is because the newest entries are appended to
 the ends of such files, which tail excels in showing. As log files can 
be a rather long, this can eliminate a lot of scrolling that would be 
necessary if some other command were used to read them. For example, the
 most recent entries to the log <i>/var/log/messages</i> can easily be viewed by using the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tail /var/log/messages</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As is the case with other programs on Unix-like operating systems, 
additional information, including variations on specific versions, can 
be obtained about the tail and head commands by consulting the built-in 
manual and information pages using commands such as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>man tail</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
or
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>info head</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
