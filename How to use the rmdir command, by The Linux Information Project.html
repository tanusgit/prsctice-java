The <i>rmdir</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is used to remove empty <i>directories</i> in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> and other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating systems</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Often referred to as a <i>folder</i> in the Macintosh and Microsoft 
Windows operating systems, a directory in Linux is merely a special type
 of file that contains a list of file names and the corresponding <a href="http://www.linfo.org/inode.html"><i>inodes</i></a> for each file and directory that it appears (to the user) to contain. An inode is a <i>data structure</i> (i.e., a way of storing data so that it can be used efficiently) that stores all the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/information.html">information</a> about a file except its name and its actual data. 
</p>

<p>
The syntax for rmdir is
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rmdir [option] directory_names</code>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
When used without any options, rm will delete any empty directories whose names are supplied as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html">arguments</a>
 (i.e., inputs) regardless of whether such directories have write 
permission or not. Thus, for example, the following command would remove
 two empty directories named <i>dir1</i> and <i>dir2</i> that are located in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html">current directory</a> (i.e., the directory in which the user is currently working): 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rmdir dir1 dir2</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The ability to remove only empty directories is a built-in safeguard 
that helps prevent the accidental loss of data. This is important 
because once deleted, it is extremely difficult or impossible to recover
 deleted data on Unix-like operating systems<font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font>. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>-p</i> (i.e., <i>parents</i>) option tells rmdir to remove the 
parent directories of the specified directory if each successive parent 
directory will, in turn, become empty and if each parent directory has 
write permission. Thus, for example, the following would remove <i>dir5</i>, <i>dir4</i> and <i>dir3</i> if dir5 were empty, dir4 only contained dir5 and dir3 only contained dir4 (which, in turn, contained dir5):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rmdir -p dir3/dir4/dir5</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This provides a nice symmetry with the <i>-p</i> option of the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/mkdir.html"><i>mkdir</i></a>
 command, which is used to create directories. Thus, the above set of 
nested directories could be easily created with the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>mkdir -p dir3/dir4/dir5</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In contrast to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/rm.html"><i>rm</i></a> command, which is used to delete both files and directories, there is no <i>-r</i> option for rmdir. at least on the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gnu.html">GNU</a> version that is standard on Linux. That option allows rm to <i>recursively</i>
 delete a directory by first deleting all of its contents, beginning 
with those in the lowest levels of subdirectories. Thus, if a user wants
 to remove an entire directory structure, it is usually most efficient 
to use rm with its -r option rather than trying to first remove the 
contents of each directory, its subdirectories, etc. 
</p>

<p>
Three options that rmdir shares with rm are <i>-v</i> (i.e., <i>verbose</i>), which provides additional information about what is happening, <i>--help</i>, which provides basic <a href="http://www.linfo.org/documentation.html">documentation</a> about rmdir, and <i>--version</i>,
 which tells the version of rmdir that is currently in use. Some 
differences exist among the various versions of rmdir, so it is always 
wise to read the documentation for the particular system. 
</p>

<font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font>This is in contrast to operating 
systems such as Microsoft Windows, in which entire directories inclusive
 of all of their contents (i.e., files and subdirectories as well as the
 contents of those subdirectories) can be easily, but superficially, 
removed by several techniques, including dragging to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gui.html">GUI</a>
 trash can. It is usually possible to retrieve items from the trash can 
before it has been emptied by merely dragging them back out of it. 
Moreover, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">programs</a> are available that can often recover data that has been deleted by emptying the trash can or by other means.
