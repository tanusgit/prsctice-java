<p> 
The <i>umount</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is used to manually <i>unmount</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filesystem.html"><i>filesystems</i></a> on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> and other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_system.html">operating systems</a>. 
</p>

<p>
A filesystem in this context is a hierarchy of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/directory.html">directories</a> that is located on a single <a href="http://www.linfo.org/partition.html">partition</a> (logically independent section of a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/hdd.html">hard disk drive</a>) or other <i>device</i>, such as a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/cdrom.html">CDROM</a>, DVD, floppy disk or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/usb.html">USB</a> key drive, and has a single <i>filesystem type</i> (i.e., method for organizing <a href="http://www.linfo.org/data.html">data</a>). 
</p>

<p>
<i>Mounting</i> refers to logically attaching a filesystem to a 
specified location on the currently accessible (and thus already 
mounted) filesystem(s) on a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/computer.html">computer</a> system so that its contents can be accessed by users. <i>Unmounting</i> refers to logically detaching a filesystem from the currently accessible filesystem(s).
</p>

<p>
All mounted filesystems are unmounted automatically when a computer is 
shut down in an orderly manner. However, there are times when it is 
necessary to unmount an individual filesystem while a computer is still 
running. A common example is when it is desired to remove an external 
device such as a USB key drive; should such device be removed before the
 filesystem on it is properly unmounted, it is possible that any data 
recently added to it might not be saved. 
</p>

<p>
The basic syntax of umount is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>umount [options] filesystem</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
umount is most commonly used without any of its several <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a>. The filesystem is identified by the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/absolute_pathname.html">full pathname</a>
 of the directory in which it has been mounted, not by its type. Thus, 
for example, to unmount a filesystem that is mounted in a directory 
called <i>/dir1</i>, all that would be necessary is to type in the following at the keyboard and press the Enter key:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>umount /dir1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, a USB key device, assuming that it had been mounted in the directory <i>/mnt/usb</i>, would be unmounted with the following: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>umount /mnt/usb</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Attempts to unmount a filesystem are not always successful. The most common problem is that the filesystem is <i>busy</i>. That is, it is currently being used by some <a href="http://www.linfo.org/process.html"><i>process</i></a> (i.e., <a href="http://www.linfo.org/instance.html">instance</a> of a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">program</a> in execution). In such case an error message such as <i>umount: /dir1: device is busy</i> will be displayed on the screen. This busy state could be the result of something as simple as an <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gui.html">GUI</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/window.html">window</a> being open that shows an <a href="http://www.linfo.org/icon.html">icon</a>
 of the directory containing the filesystem, in which case it can be 
easily solved by closing the window. Or it could be the result of a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/file.html">file</a>
 on that filesystem being open, in which case all that is necessary is 
to close the file. In less obvious cases, it may be necessary to use a 
command such as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/ps.html"><i>ps</i></a> or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pstree.html"><i>pstree</i></a> to try to locate the offending process(es) and then use a command such as  <a href="http://www.linfo.org/kill.html"><i>kill</i></a> to terminate such process(es).
</p>

<p>
Another cause of failure is when a user attempts to unmount a filesystem
 that has already been unmounted. In such case an error message such as <i>umount: /dir1: not mounted</i> will be returned. 
</p>

<p>
In the event that the unmounting is successful, umount usually works <i>silently</i>;
 that is, there is no message on the screen to confirm its success. 
However, umount can be made to provide such a message by using the <i>-v</i> (i.e., <i>verbose</i>) option. (This should not be confused with the <i>-V</i> option, which merely returns information about the currently installed version of umount.)
</p>

<p>
umount allows the name of the physical device on which the filesystem is
 mounted to be included in the command if desired. This is convenient 
because it can minimize typing by allowing the user to utilize the 
upward pointing arrow on the keyboard to display the command that was 
previously used to mount that filesystem (i.e., to use the <i>history</i> command) and then merely insert the letter <i>u</i> before the word <i>mount</i>
 and press the Enter key in order to unmount the filesystem. Thus, for 
example, if a filesystem that is physically located on the second 
partition of the first HDD (which is designated by <i>dev/hda2</i>) is mounted in a directory called <i>/dir2</i>, it can be unmounted with either of the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>umount /dir2</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
or
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>umount /dev/hda2 /dir2</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Interestingly, when the physical device is included, a confirmation message is automatically supplied. 
</p>

<p>
There are several options that can be tried in the event that umount 
refuses to unmount a filesystem for no immediately apparent reason. 
Perhaps the most useful is the <i>-l</i> (i.e., <i>lazy</i>) option, 
which immediately detaches the filesystem from the main filesystem and 
then cleans up all references to the unmounted filesystem as soon as it 
is no longer busy. This capability requires Linux <a href="http://www.linfo.org/kernel.html">kernel</a> 2.4.11 or later.
</p>

<p>
Another way to deal with an unmounting failure is to use the <i>-r</i> 
option, which remounts the filesystem as read-only. This presumably 
allows devices or media to be removed without affecting data which has 
just been written to them. In addition, the <i>-f</i> option <i>forces</i> unmounting in the case of an unreachable NFS (network filesystem) filesystem. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>-a</i> option causes <i>all</i> of the filesystems described in <i>/etc/mtab</i>
 to be unmounted. (However, with umount version 2.7 and later the proc 
filesystem is not unmounted.) /etc/mtab is a file that is similar to <a href="http://www.linfo.org/etc_fstab.html"><i>/etc/fstab</i></a> and which is updated by mount and umount whenever filesystems are mounted or unmounted. The <i>-n</i> option causes unmounting to occur without writing to /etc/mtab.
</p>

<p>
The <i>-t</i> option followed by the filesystem type indicates that the 
actions should only be taken on filesystems  of that type. Multiple 
types can be specified in a comma-separated list. This list can be 
prefixed with the word <i>no</i> to specify filesystem types on which  no action should be taken. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>-O</i> options indicate that the actions should only be taken on 
filesystems with the specified options in /etc/fstab. Multiple option 
types can be specified in a comma-separated list. Those options for 
which no action should be taken can be prefixed with <i>no</i>.
</p>

<p>
umount will free any <i>loop device</i> associated with
a mounted filesystem if it finds the option <i>loop=...</i> in /etc/mtab or if the -d option is used. A loop device is a <i>pseudo-device</i> that is able to redirect and transform data that goes through its <i>loop</i> and which is used mainly used for encrypting filesystems.
</p>

<p>
Note the symmetry between the umount and mount commands, including the 
fact that many of the options are identical or very similar (including 
-a, -h, -r, -t, -O, -v and -V). This is consistent with the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html">Unix philosophy</a>,
 a fundamental component of which is simplicity (and hence consistency 
to the extent practical among commands), in that it eliminates 
unnecessary complexity.
</p>

<p>
umount could have instead been called <i>unmount</i>. This might have simplified things for people who are new to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line.html">command line</a> (i.e., text-only operation). However, eliminating unnecessary typing is also a part of the Unix philosophy, and thus the <i>n</i> was not used.
