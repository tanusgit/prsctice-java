<p>
The <i>man</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is used to format and display the <i>man pages</i>.
</p>

<p>
The man pages are a user manual that is by default built into most <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/distributions_list.html"><i>distributions</i></a> (i.e., versions) and most other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_system.html">operating systems</a> during installation. They provide extensive <a href="http://www.linfo.org/documentation.html">documentation</a> about commands and other aspects of the system, including <i>configuration files</i>, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/system_call.html"><i>system calls</i></a>, <i>library routines</i> and the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/kernel.html"><i>kernel</i></a> (i.e., the core of the operating system). A configuration file is a type of simple <a href="http://www.linfo.org/database.html">database</a> that contains <a href="http://www.linfo.org/data.html">data</a> that tells a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">program</a> or operating system how to behave. A system call is a request made via a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/software_interrupt.html"><i>software interrupt</i></a> (i.e., a signal to the kernel initiated by software) by an <i>active process</i> for a <i>service</i>
 performed by the kernel. A library routine is a subprogram that is used
 by programmers to simplify the development of software. 
</p>

<p>
The man pages are tailored to the particular operating system, and 
version thereof, on which they are installed. This is beneficial because
 there can be slight differences in commands and other items according 
to the particular system.
</p>

<p>
The descriptions are rather terse, and they can seem somewhat cryptic to
 new users. However, users typically find them to be increasingly useful
 as they become more familiar with them and gain experience in the use 
of Unix-like operating systems.
</p>

<p>
The man command itself is extremely easy to use. Its basic syntax is
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>man [option(s)] keyword(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
man is most commonly used without any <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a>
 and with only one keyword. The keyword is the exact name of the command
 or other item for which information is desired. For example, the 
following provides information about the <i>ls</i> command (which is used to list the contents of any specified directory):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>man ls</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As another example, the following displays the man page about the man pages:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>man man</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
man automatically sends its output through a <i>pager</i>, usually the program <i>less</i>.
 A pager is a program that causes the output of any program to be 
displayed one screenful at a time, rather than having a large amount of 
text scroll down the screen at high (and generally unreadable) speed.
</p>

<p>
less writes a colon at the bottom of the screen to indicate the end of 
the on-screen page. The user can move to the next page by pushing the 
space bar and can return to the previous page by pressing the <i>b</i> key. Pressing the <i>q</i> exits the man pages and returns the user to the shell program.
</p>

<p>
Each man page is a self-contained article that is divided into a number 
of sections, the headers for which are labeled with upper case letters. 
The sections for commands are typically something like NAME, SYNOPSIS, 
DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, AUTHOR, BUGS, COPYRIGHT, HISTORY and SEE ALSO, 
although there may be some differences according to the particular 
command. Some of these might be broken down into subsections, 
particularly OPTIONS in the case of a command that has numerous options.
 
</p>

<p>
Also, the man pages as a whole are organized into sections, each 
containing pages about a specific category of topics as shown below. The
 section to which an article belongs is indicted in parenthesis in the 
top line, before the NAME header. 
</p>

<blockquote> 1. executable programs or shell commands 
<br> 2. system calls 
<br> 3. library routines 
<br> 4. special files (i.e., <i>devices</i> in the <i>/dev</i> directory)
<br> 5. file formats
<br> 6. games 
<br> 7. macro packages 
<br> 8. system administration commands
<br> 9. kernel routines 
<br> n. Tcl/Tk (a programming language)
</blockquote>

<p>
Some topic names will have multiple articles, depending on context. For instance, there are two articles for <i>mount</i>, one corresponding to its use as a command in system management (i.e., to logically attach <a href="http://www.linfo.org/partition.html">partition</a> or other <i>devices</i> to the main <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filesystem.html">filesystem</a>) and the other for use in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/c.html">C programming language</a>.
 Generally, the most commonly used topic is displayed by default, and 
there are references to any other topics with the same name in the SEE 
ALSO section at the bottom of the final on-screen page. 
</p>

<p>
The syntax to specify an article from a particular section is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>man section_number keyword</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, for example, the following would display the article about mount from Section 2 instead of from the default Section 8:
</p>

<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>
<code>man 2 mount</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>-w</i> and <i>-W</i> options tell man to not actually display the
 man pages, but to provide the location(s) of the file(s) that would be 
formatted or displayed. If no <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>arguments</i></a> (i.e., input files) are provided, a list of directories that is searched by man for man pages is returned. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>-f</i> option produces the same output as the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/whatis.html"><i>whatis</i></a>
 command. whatis provides very brief descriptions of commands from a 
database that is automatically created from the first line of the NAME 
section of each relevant man page. The <i>-h</i> option displays a terse summary of man's syntax and options.
</p>

<p>
A simpler  version  of a man page, i.e., without backspaces and underscores, can be obtained by <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pipes.html"><i>piping</i></a> (i.e., transferring) its output to the <i>col</i> command used with its <i>-b</i> option. Thus, for example, the following would write such a version of the man page about the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pstree.html"><i>pstree</i></a> command (which shows the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/process.html">processes</a> currently on the system in a tree diagram) to a text file called <i>pstree.txt</i> (and create a file with this name if it did not already exist): 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>man pstree | col -b &gt; pstree.txt</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Unix-like operating systems often also have an additional built-in manual referred to as the <i>Info documents</i>, the content of which is largely identical to that of the man pages. These documents can be accessed with the <i>info</i> command.
</p>
 
<p>
Although the man pages are usually viewed in a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/console.html"><i>console</i></a> (i.e., all-text mode) or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/terminal_window.html"><i>terminal window</i></a> (i.e., a text-mode <a href="http://www.linfo.org/window.html">window</a> in a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gui.html">GUI</a>), they can also be viewed in the <i>Konquerer</i> web browser, which is included with many Linux distributions. Some users might find that this provides enhanced <a href="http://www.linfo.org/usability.html">usability</a>,
 including the ability to scroll up and down an entire article 
regardless of its length and greater ease of changing font sizes. Any 
man article can be displayed in Konquerer by typing <i>man</i> followed by a colon and the name of the program.
</p>
 
<p>
Thus, for example, the following would tell Konquerer to display the man page for pstree:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>man:pstree</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="http://www.bellevuelinux.org/linfo.html">The Linux Information Project</a>
 (LINFO) is providing an on-line alternative to the man pages with its 
series of articles about commonly used commands and other aspects of 
Linux. One major difference is that the LINFO articles are designed to 
be useful to users of all levels, including absolute beginners. In 
particular, emphasis is placed on the most useful options for commands 
and specific examples are often provided. An index, along with brief 
descriptions, of such articles about commands that have been provided to
 date is <a href="http://www.bellevuelinux.org/command_index.html"><i>Index of Linux Commands</i></a>.
