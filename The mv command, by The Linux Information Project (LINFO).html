<p>
The <i>mv</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is used to rename and move files and directories. Its general syntax is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>mv [options] argument(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The  <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>arguments</i></a> 
are names of files and directories. If two file names are provided as 
arguments, mv renames the first as the second. If a list of arguments is
 provided and the final argument in the sequence is the name of an 
existing directory, mv moves all of the other items into that directory.
 If the final argument is not an existing directory and more than two 
arguments are provided, an error message is returned.
</p>

<p>
mv's syntax can also be expressed in a less general form as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>mv [options] source target</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the target file is located in the same directory as the source file, 
then the source file can only be renamed. If both are in different 
directories, then the source file is moved to the directory named in the
 <i>target</i> argument, in which it can keep its original name or be 
assigned a new name. If the target is a directory, then the source file 
or directory is moved into that directory and retains its original name.
 
</p>

<p>
Thus, for example, the following would rename a file called <i>file1</i> to <i>file2</i>, while keeping it in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html"><i>current directory</i></a> (i.e., the directory in which the user is currently working):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>mv file1 file2</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following would move a file named <i>file3</i>, without changing its name, from the current directory to an existing subdirectory of the current directory named <i>dir1</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>mv file3 dir1/file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
mv can be used to move any number of files and directories 
simultaneously. For example, the following command moves all files and 
directories, including all the contents of those directories, from the 
current directory to the directory <i>/home/alice/new/</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>mv * /home/alice/new/</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The asterisk is a <i>wildcard</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linfo.html">character</a> that represents any <a href="http://www.linfo.org/string.html"><i>string</i></a>
 (i.e., sequence of characters). Thus, in the above example it 
represents the name of every file and directory in the current 
directory.
</p>

<p>
mv makes it as easy to move a file or directory up the hierarchy of directories (i.e., closer to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root_directory.html"><i>root directory</i></a>) as down it. For example, the following would move a file named <i>file4</i>, which is currently located in the sub-subdirectory <i>dir/dir/</i> of the user's <a href="http://www.linfo.org/home_directory.html"><i>home directory</i></a>, to the top level in the user's home directory: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>mv dir/dir/file4 ~</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The root directory is the directory that contains all other directories on a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating system</a>
 and which is at the top of the hierarchy of directories. A user's home 
directory is the directory in which a user finds itself by default after
 <a href="http://www.linfo.org/login_def.html">logging into</a> the system and which can be represented by the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/tilde.html"><i>tilde</i></a> (wavy horizontal line <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">character</a>).
</p>

<p>
By default, mv does not provide any confirmation on the display screen 
if its action is completed without problems. This is consistent with the
 <a href="http://www.linfo.org/rule_of_silence.html"><i>rule of silence</i></a> tenet of the Unix philosophy. 
</p>

<p>
Thus it is wise for users new to Unix-like operating systems to always use the -i <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">option</a>,
 which makes mv interactive in the situation in which files and/or 
directories with the same name already exist in the destination 
directory. For example, the above command would be made interactive as 
follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>mv -i * /home/alice/new/</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>
Among mv's few other options are <i>-b</i>, which tells it to make a backup copy of each file that would otherwise be overwritten or removed, and <i>-v</i>, which tells it to be <i>verbose</i>
 and display the name of each file before moving it. Detailed 
information (including all options) about mv can be obtained by using 
its <i>--help</i> option, and information about the current version can be obtained by using its <i>--version</i> option.
