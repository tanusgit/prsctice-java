<p>
The <i>whoami</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> writes the user name (i.e., login name) of the owner of the current <a href="http://www.linfo.org/login_def.html">login</a> session to <a href="http://www.linfo.org/standard_output.html"><i>standard output</i></a>. Standard output is, by default, the display screen, unless <a href="http://www.linfo.org/redirection.html">redirected</a> to a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/file.html">file</a>, printer, etc.
</p>

<p>
whoami is particularly useful when using <a href="http://www.linfo.org/shell.html"><i>shells</i></a> such as <i>ash</i> and <i>sh</i> that do not show the name of the current user in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_prompt.html"><i>command prompt</i></a> (a short text message at the start of the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line.html">command line</a> on an all-text display). It is also useful for confirming the current owner of a session after using the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/su.html"><i>su</i></a> (i.e., substitute user) command, which changes the owner of the session without the original owner having to first log out.

</p>

<p>
A shell is a program that provides the traditional, text-only <a href="http://www.linfo.org/user_interface.html">user interface</a> for <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_system.html">operating systems</a>. Its primary function is to read commands that are typed into a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/console.html"><i>console</i></a> (i.e., an all-text display mode) or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/terminal_window.html"><i>terminal window</i></a> (an all-text <a href="http://www.linfo.org/window.html">window</a> in a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gui.html">GUI</a>) and then <i>execute</i> (i.e., run) them. 

</p>

<p>
The formal syntax for whoami is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>whoami [option]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When used without any <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a> or redirection, as it usually is, i.e.,

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>whoami</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and followed by pressing the ENTER key, whoami displays on the monitor screen the user name of the owner of the current session.
</p>

<p>
There are only two options for whoami: <i>--help</i> and <i>--version</i>. The former outputs the very brief description that is contained in the <i>man</i> (i.e., built-in system manual) pages, and the latter outputs the number of the version currently installed on the system.

</p>

<p>
whoami produces the same result as the <i>id</i> command (which by default provides more detailed information about the current user than does whoami) when id is used with its <i>-u</i> and <i>-n</i> options, i.e., 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<code>id -un</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The -u option tells id to provide only the identification for the 
current owner of the session, and the -n option tells it to present that
 identification as the user name instead of as a number.
</p>

<p>
The <i>who</i> command differs from whoami in that it provides a list of <i>all</i>
 users currently logged into the system as well as additional 
information about each of those users (including login times and 
terminal numbers). It also differs in that, in the event of a change in 
ownership of a login session through the use of the su command, it 
reports the original owner of the session, whereas whoami provides the 
user name of the effective (i.e., current) owner of the session.
