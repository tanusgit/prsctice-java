<table width="520" align="center"><tbody><tr><td>

<p> 
The combination of a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/dot.html">dot</a> followed directly by a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/forward_slash.html">forward slash</a> (./) is often used to precede <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">commands</a> in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> and other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_system.html">operating systems</a>.
 Although this requirement can seem confusing and even tedious to new 
users, it exists for good reason and can be useful to understand.
</p>

<p>
Commands in Unix-like operating systems are either <i>built-ins</i> or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/executable.html"><i>executables</i></a>. The former (e.g., <a href="http://www.linfo.org/alias.html">alias</a>, cd, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/echo.html">echo</a>, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/kill.html">kill</a>, ls and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pwd.html">pwd</a>) are part of the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/shell.html"><i>shell</i></a>
 that is currently running, and thus the shell can always locate them. 
In contrast, the shell needs help in finding the latter, which can be 
divided into <i>compiled programs</i> and <i>shell scripts</i>. A compiled program is a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">program</a> whose <a href="http://www.linfo.org/source_code.html">source code</a> (i.e., its original, human-readable form) has been converted through the use of a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/compiler.html">compiler</a> into an <i>executable file</i> (i.e., a ready-to-run form).
</p>

<p>
A shell is a program that provides the traditional, text-only <a href="http://www.linfo.org/user_interface.html">user interface</a> for Unix-like operating systems. Its primary function is to read commands that are typed in at the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line.html"><i>command line</i></a> (i.e., in a text-only mode) and then <i>execute</i> (i.e., run) them. A shell script is a short program that is written in a shell programming language and <i>interpreted</i> (i.e., converted into runnable form) by a shell <a href="http://www.linfo.org/process.html">process</a>. 
</p>

<p>
When some text is typed into a shell and then the ENTER key is pressed, 
the shell assumes that it is a command. The shell immediately checks to 
see if the first <a href="http://www.linfo.org/string.html"><i>string</i></a> (i.e., sequence of characters) in that text is a built-in command or the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/absolute_pathname.html"><i>absolute path</i></a> (i.e., location relative to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root_directory">root directory</a>) to an executable. 
</p>

<p>
If it is neither of these, the shell will search the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/directory.html">directories</a> listed in that users' <a href="http://www.linfo.org/path_env_var.html">PATH</a> <i>environmental variable</i>
 for a file with that name. PATH (all upper case letters) tells the 
shell which directories to search for commands in response to commands 
issued by the user. 
</p>

<p>
If the command is found, it will be executed, assuming that there are no
 other problems. If it is not found, an error message, such as <i>command not found</i>, will be returned. 
</p>

<p>
Most users work most of the time in their <a href="http://www.linfo.org/home_directory.html">home directory</a>
 and subdirectories thereof because of convenience and for safety 
reasons. However, by default such directories are not included in the 
user's PATH variable. Thus when the user creates a script or compiles a 
program in one of those directories and attempts to run it by merely 
typing in its name, an error message will be returned.
</p>

<p>
However, this problem can be easily overcome by typing a dot and slash 
in front of the command name. This is merely an abbreviated way to 
inform the shell that the absolute path of that file is the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html" <i="">current directory</a>
 (i.e., the directory in which the user is currently working). In 
Unix-like operating systems, a single dot is used to represent the 
current directory in a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/path.html"><i>path</i></a> (i.e., the location of a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/file.html">file</a> or directory in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filesystem">filesystem</a>), including those used in commands. Likewise, forward slashes are used to separate directories and files in paths. 
</p>

<p>
Files in the current directory can be accessed for reading and writing by merely entering the command name (e.g., <a href="http://www.linfo.org/cat.html"><i>cat</i></a> or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/vi/index.html"><i>vi</i></a>)
 followed by the name of the file. That is, no absolute path is 
necessary. However, when execution is desired, either an absolute path 
(or its dot slash equivalent) or the inclusion of the directory 
containing the command's executable file in the PATH variable is 
necessary. This is a built-in safety mechanism.
</p>

<p>
A user could eliminate the need to precede commands by a dot slash by 
appending a single dot to the PATH variable, because this would tell the
 shell to also search the current directory. However, this is generally 
not advisable on safety and security grounds. For example, were the user
 to inadvertently create a shell script with the same name as a standard
 command, the shell could execute the former instead of the latter, 
thereby causing the system to malfunction, or worse.<font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font> 
</p>

<p>
A better alternative if one wants to eliminate the need to precede 
commands by a dot slash is to create a special directory for the 
executable files of such commands, and then add this directory to the 
PATH variable. For example, a user named <i>bob</i> could create a directory named <i>bin</i> in his home directory (i.e., <i>/home/bob/bin/</i>) for this purpose.
</p>

<p>
Another approach for making it easy to run a program that is installed 
in a non-standard directory is to create a symbolic link to it (using 
the <i>ln</i> command with its <i>-s</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">option</a>),
 and then put the link in a directory that is already in the PATH 
variable. This can be a safer alternative to adding more directories to 
PATH.
</p>

<p>
The dot slash should not be confused with <i>Slashdot</i>, which is the name of a popular <a href="http://www.linfo.org/web.html">web</a> site about <a href="http://www.linfo.org/computer.html">computer</a> technology.
</p>

<font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font>An extreme example would be the situation in which an ordinary user created a shell script such as <i>rm -r /</i>, which would delete all files and directories in the system for which the user had writing <a href="http://www.linfo.org/permissions.html">permission</a>, and named this script <i>ls</i>.
 Were the system administrator to navigate to the directory in which 
this script was located and attempt to run the standard ls command in 
order to view the contents of that directory, the shell would instead 
run the script with the same name and thereby remove the contents of all
 currently <a href="http://www.linfo.org/mounting.html">mounted</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/partition.html">partitions</a> on the computer!
