<p>
One of the characteristics of the English written language is that its <i>orthography</i>
 (i.e., spelling) is complex and can be difficult to remember. This is 
in contrast to many languages (e.g., Spanish and German) for which the 
spelling of words is closely related to their pronunciation. 
Fortunately, technology has come to the rescue, and there are multiple 
ways to check and correct spelling on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> and other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating systems</a>. 
</p>

<p>
One of the simplest, and sometimes most convenient, of these spelling checkers is the <i>spell</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a>.
 Despite its lack of sophisticated features, it is still worth being 
aware of spell for several reasons, including (1) it is very easy to 
use, (2) it can be found on many Unix-like systems and (3) it is well 
suited for use with other commands linked by <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pipe.html"><i>pipes</i></a> (which are used to combine commands). 
</p>

<p>
spell compares words typed in at the keyboard or the contents of a text 
file to those in a built-in dictionary file and then writes all of the 
words not in the dictionary (and, therefore, presumably misspelled) to <a href="http://www.linfo.org/standard_output.html"><i>standard output</i></a> (which is the display screen by default). 
</p>

<p>
On some systems spell is a stand-alone program, either the original version or the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gnu.html">GNU</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/clone.html">clone</a>. On others, such as Red Hat Linux 9, it is a <i>shell script</i> (i.e., a simple program) that launches a simplified version of another spelling checking program, <i>aspell</i>, which emulates the core function of spell. 
</p>

<p>
spell displays each presumably misspelled word on a new line. In the case of the Red Hat version, the words are displayed in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/alphabet.html">alphabet</a>ic
 order and each erroneous spelling is displayed only once, regardless of
 the number of times that it appears in the text. If multiple files are 
specified for checking, a single, alphabetized list of words is still 
generated. 
</p>

<p>
spell's syntax is
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>spell [options] [file_name(s)]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The items in the square brackets are optional. When no file names are supplied as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html">arguments</a> (i.e., inputs), spell will read from <a href="http://www.linfo.org/standard_input.html">standard input</a>, which by default is text typed in at the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line.html">command line</a>. 
</p>

<p>
For example, it can easily be determined whether the word <i>desireable</i> is spelled correctly by first entering at the command line the <code>spell</code> command, pressing the RETURN key, typing the word <code>desireable</code>, pressing RETURN again and then simultaneously press the CONTROL key and the <i>d</i> key. The output will look like the following:
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
<code>$ spell</code><br>
<code>desireable</code> <br>
<code>desireable</code><br>
<code>$</code><br>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The word <i>desireable</i> is <i>echoed</i> (i.e., repeated by the 
system) because it is not in the system dictionary and is thus quite 
likely a spelling error. If the same procedure is repeated using <i>desirable</i> (i.e., omitting the second <i>e</i>),
 then it is not echoed, because it is in the system dictionary and is 
therefore the correct spelling. Thus, the screen would look like:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>$ spell</code><br>
<code>desirable</code> <br>
<code>$</code><br>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
spell can also be used with lists of words  and sentences. For example, typing <code>spell</code>, pressing the RETURN key, typing the sentence &nbsp;  <code>This is the storry abuot an operating system that went from baad to wurse,</code> &nbsp; pressing RETURN again, and finally simultaneously pressing the CONTROL key and the <i>d</i> key would produce the following output:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>$ spell</code><br>
<code>This is the storry abuot an operating system that went from baad to wurse</code> <br>
<code>abuot</code><br>
<code>baad</code><br>
<code>storry</code><br>
<code>wurse</code><br>
<code>$</code><br>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To find any spelling errors in a file, all that is necessary to supply 
the name of the file as an argument after the command and any options. 
For example, the following will search for errors in a file named <i>file1</i>: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>spell file1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
spell can be used to check any number of files simultaneously by listing them all as arguments, for example:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>spell file1 file2 file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is then a simple matter to correct the misspellings using a text editor (e.g., <a href="http://www.linfo.org/vi/index.html"><i>vi</i></a> or <i>gedit</i>).
</p>

<p>
As is the case with other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filter.html">filters</a>, the output of spell can be redirected from standard output using the <i>standard output redirection operator</i>,
 which is designated by a rightward facing angular bracket. For example,
 the following tells spell to check the spelling of all words in the 
first three files and write its output to <i>file4</i> instead of to the display screen:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>spell file1 file2 file3 &gt; file4</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The output of spell can also be further processed by using pipes to send
 it to other filters. For example, in the following example the output 
of spell is piped to <i>grep</i> (which is used to search for files and the contents of files) in order to display only those misspelled words in <i>file5</i> that contain the sequence of letters <i>com</i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>spell file5 | grep com </code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The output could likewise be redirected to a file instead of to the display screen, such as to a new or existing file named <i>file6</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>spell file5 | grep com &gt; file6</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<br>

<p>
Although spell is very useful for checking text against the several tens
 of thousands of commonly used words in the English language that are 
included in the dictionary file, it does not do a good job of checking 
technical terminology, proper nouns (e.g., names of people, places and 
products) and slang.  
</p>

<p>
Also, spell is not <i>interactive</i>. That is, it does not highlight 
misspelled words in a file and assist the user in correcting them one by
 one in the context of the text. However, this can be an advantage in 
some cases, particularly if the user merely wants to see a list of the 
potentially misspelled words in a file without having to go through and 
attempt to correct all of them. 
</p>

<p>
Moreover, some of the useful features that come with the original 
version of spell are not found on the aspell emulation version. For 
example, the original Unix version has several options, including <i>-b</i>, which accepts UK spellings (e.g. labour, colour, centre), and <i>-x</i>,
 which displays every possible stem for each word. The original version 
also allows users to create their own supplementary dictionary files, 
which can be very useful for adding technical terms and proper nouns. 
</p>

<p>
When more features are desired for a command line spelling checker than 
are available on the the aspell emulation version, the user should 
consider installing the original version of spell or its GNU clone or 
using a more sophisticated program such as aspell or <i>ispell</i>, both
 of which are interactive and allow the use of user-created 
dictionaries. aspell is better at making suggestions when a word is 
seriously misspelled, whereas ispell has the advantage that it can be 
used with numerous foreign languages.  
</p>

This article was written using the <i>gedit</i> text editor on a Red Hat
 9 Linux machine. spell was used to check the spelling after the final 
proofreading by the author, and it found several errors. Interestingly, 
the only word that was misspelled multiple times was the word <i>misspell</i> itself, which was spelled <i>mispell</i>.
