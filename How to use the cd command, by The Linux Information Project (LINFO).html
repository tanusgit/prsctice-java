<p>
The <i>cd</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is used to change the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html"><i>current directory</i></a> (i.e., the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/directory.html">directory</a> in which the user is currently working) in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> and other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_system.html">operating systems</a>. It is similar to the CD and CHDIR commands in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/ms-dos.html">MS-DOS</a>. 
</p>

<p></p>
cd's syntax is
<p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>
<code>cd [option] [directory]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The items in square brackets are optional. When used without specifying 
any directory name, cd returns the user to the previous current 
directory.  This provides a convenient means of toggling between two 
directories. 
</p>

<p>
When a directory name is provided, cd changes the current directory to it. The name can be expressed as an <a href="http://www.linfo.org/absolute_pathname.html"><i>absolute pathname</i></a> (i.e., location relative to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root_directory.html">root directory</a>) or as a <i>local pathname</i>
 (i.e., location relative to the current directory). It is usually more 
convenient to use a local pathname when changing to a subdirectory of 
the current directory. 
</p>

<p>
As an example, the following would change the current directory, 
regardless of where it is on the system (because it is an absolute 
path), to the root directory (which is represented by a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/forward_slash.html">forward slash</a>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cd /</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, the following would change the current directory, regardless of its location, to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/usr_sbin.html"><i>/usr/sbin</i></a> directory (which contains non-vital system utilities that are used by the system administrator):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cd /usr/sbin</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If a user currently in the directory <i>/usr/local/share/man/</i> desired to change to the directory <i>/usr/local/share/man/man2</i>, which is a subdirectory of the current directory, it would be possible to change by using the absolute pathname, i.e., 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cd /usr/local/share/man/man2</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, it would clearly be much less tedious to use the relative pathname, i.e., 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cd man2</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On Unix-like operating systems the current directory is represented by a single <a href="http://www.linfo.org/dot.html">dot</a> and its <i>parent directory</i>
 (i.e., the directory that contains it) is represented by two 
consecutive dots. Thus, it is possible (and often convenient) to change 
to the parent of the current directory by using the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cd ..</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another convenient feature of cd is the ability for any user to return directly to its <a href="http://www.linfo.org/home_directory.html"><i>home directory</i></a> by merely using a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/tilde.html"><i>tilde</i></a> as the argument. A home directory, also called a <i>login directory</i>, is the directory on a Unix-like operating system that serves as the repository for a user's personal <a href="http://www.linfo.org/file.html">files</a>, directories and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">programs</a>. It is also the directory that a user is first in after <a href="http://www.linfo.org/login_def.html">logging into</a> the system. A tilde is a short, wavy, horizontal line <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">character</a>
 that represents the home directory of the current user. That is, any 
user can return immediately to its home directory by typing the 
following and then pressing the Enter key:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cd ~</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is easier than typing the full name of the user's home directory, for instance, <i>/home/josephine</i> in the case of a user named <i>josephine</i>. (And it is just one of the numerous shortcuts that help make the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line.html">command line</a> on Unix-like operating systems so easy to use.) 
</p>

<p>
When followed by a space and then a hyphen, cd both returns the user to 
the previous current directory and reports on a new line the absolute 
pathname of that directory. This can further enhance the already 
convenient toggling capability of cd. Toggling is particularly 
convenient when at least one of the two directories has a long absolute 
pathname, such as /usr/local/share/man/man2.
</p>

<p>
cd has only two <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a>, and neither of them are commonly used. The <i>-P</i> option instructs cd to use the physical directory structure instead of following  symbolic links. The <i>-L</i> option forces symbolic links to be followed.
