<p>
The PDP-7 was a <i>minicomputer</i> which was shipped by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1965. Its greatest claim to fame by far is that it is the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/computer.html">computer</a> for which the first version of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix_upper.html">UNIX</a> was created. 
</p>

<p>
Minicomputers were <i>third generation</i> computers that made efficient use of discrete transistors and <i>magnetic core <a href="http://www.linfo.org/memory.html">memories</a></i>
 (i.e., arrays of tiny rings made from a magnetic ceramic material) in 
place of vacuum tubes to reduce their size, purchase price and operating
 cost to only small fractions of those for the <i>mainframe</i> computers which still dominated high performance computing. 
</p>

<p>
Minicomputers also bridged the huge performance gap between the high capacity mainframes and the low powered <i>microcomputers</i>. The latter were relatively simple, single-user machines that ran simple <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_system.html">operating systems</a> such as CP/M or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/ms-dos.html">MS-DOS</a>. Minicomputers, in contrast, ran full multi-user, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/multitasking.html"><i>multitasking</i></a> operating systems such as VMS (developed by DEC) and UNIX. 
</p>

<p>
A multitasking operating system is one in which multiple <a href="http://www.linfo.org/process.html"><i>processes</i></a> can <i>execute</i>
 (i.e., run) on a single computer seemingly simultaneously and without 
interfering with each other. A process, also referred to as a <i>task</i>, is a running <a href="http://www.linfo.org/instance.html">instance</a> of a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">program</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Established in 1957 by three graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of
 Technology (MIT) and initially operated out of an old wool mill in 
Maynard, Massachusetts, DEC was a pioneer in the U.S. computer industry.
 At its peak in 1990 it employed more than 120,000 people worldwide and 
earned more than $14 billion in revenue. The company was acquired in 
1998 by Compaq Computer Corporation, which subsequently merged with 
Hewlett-Packard in 2001.  
</p>

<p><br><strong>The PDP Series</strong>
</p>

<p>
During the 1960s DEC introduced its influential PDP series of 
minicomputers that featured magnetic core memories and a variety of 
other advanced technologies. A key to the success of this series was its
 suitability for that large market segment that could not afford 
mainframes.
</p>

<p>
PDP was an abbreviation for <i>Programmed Data Processor</i>. 
The company did not want its machines to be called <i>computers</i> 
because a study had predicted that the world market for computers would 
be very small, perhaps less than a hundred. It was the conventional 
wisdom of the time (even among the government and DEC's stockholders) 
that computers were big and expensive and required a dedicated computer 
center and a large supporting staff. DEC chose to avoid dealing with 
these stereotypes by entirely avoiding the term <i>computer</i>.
</p>

<p>
DEC's first computer, the PDP-1, entered production in 1960. It was 
priced at only $120,000 for a basic system at a time when other 
computers typically sold for well in excess of a million dollars. It 
also featured low operating costs and ease of use, including the ability
 to be operated by a single person and the building in of a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/crt.html">CRT</a> (cathode ray tube) display on which images could be drawn using an accompanying <i>light pen</i>.
</p>

<p>
The PDP-1 had a time-sharing operating system and a
magnetic core memory that held 4096 words of 18 <a href="http://www.linfo.org/bit.html">bits</a>
 each. Memory capacity could be expanded in increments of 4096 words to a
 maximum of 65,536 words, and it could be supplemented by up to 24 
magnetic tape drive <a href="http://www.linfo.org/storage.html">storage</a>
 units. Driving currents were automatically adjusted to compensate for 
temperature variations between 50 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</p>

<p>
The PDP-1 is perhaps best remembered today for being the computer most important in the creation of the early <i>hacker</i>
 (i.e., computer expert) culture at MIT and elsewhere. It was also 
significant in that in 1962 it became the first computer used for 
playing a computer game, Steve Russell's <i>Spacewar</i>.
</p>

<p>
The PDP-1 was followed by a succession of models with a wide range of 
prices and performance levels. The most powerful of these were fully 
worthy of the large computer centers with big support staffs that were 
required by mainframes. Some early models, such as the PDP-3, were not 
actually built by DEC itself but rather by customers using DEC parts and
 facilities. 
</p>

<p>
The PDP-4, DEC's second 18-bit model, was introduced in 1963 as a 
cheaper, but slower, alternative to the PDP-1. It was not commercially 
successful, with only about 54 units being sold. However, all of the 
company's subsequent 18-bit PDP models were based on its simplified <i>instructions set</i> (i.e., the set of commands that the computer's processor can understand and execute).
</p>

<p>
Among the more notable of the PDP-1's successors was the PDP-6, which 
was shipped in 1964. It was a large, high capacity model and sported a 
36-bit word size. The price was the same as for the PDP-1, and 
approximately 23 units were built. 
</p>

<p><br>
<strong>The PDP-7</strong>
</p>

<p>
The PDP-7, which was introduced in 1965, was developed as a less 
expensive alternative to the PDP-4, with a price of only U.S.$72,000 for
 a minimal system. It also had an 18-bit word length, and its standard 
main memory was 4K words (equivalent to nine kilo<a href="http://www.linfo.org/byte.html">bytes</a>) but upgradeable to 64K words (144 KB). Minuscule by today's standards, this amount of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/ram.html">RAM</a> (random access memory) core memory was considered substantial at the time, especially given the low price of the system.  
</p>

<p>
The PDP-7's <a href="http://www.linfo.org/cpu.html">CPU</a> (central 
processing unit) was implemented using a large number of small circuit 
cards. As was the case with DEC's earlier models, all logic was formed 
from discrete components (i.e, individual transistors, diodes and 
resistors); that is, no integrated circuits (ICs) were used. 
</p>

<p>
The PDP-7 also featured DEC's first mass storage-based operating system. This was made possible by the company's new <i>DECtape</i>
 random access, block addressable, small format magnetic tape system. 
For the first time, tape was divided into sectors so that it could be 
used as an input/output storage system that was both interactive and 
inexpensive. The tapes were used in a way similar to how floppy disks 
were later used.
</p>

<p>
Like its predecessors, input and output was conducted via a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/teletype.html"><i>teletypewriter</i></a>, also referred to as a <i>teletype</i>
 machine, a kind of electromechanical typewriter that was commonly used 
for communication, and a punched paper tape drive unit for low cost 
storage of programs and data was included. There was also a high quality
 DEC 340 CRT display unit with a round, ten-inch screen which could draw
 simple vector graphics, and an accompanying light pen could be used to 
draw on the display screen. 
</p>

<p>
The system also included an advanced Fortran II <a href="http://www.linfo.org/compiler.html"><i>compiler</i></a>, a symbolic <i>assembler</i>, a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/text_editor.html">text editor</a>,
 a debugging system, maintenance routines and a library of arithmetic, 
utility and programming aids that had been developed on the PDP-4. 
Fortran is a programming language that was developed in the 1950s and 
which is still widely used for scientific and numerical applications. A 
compiler is a specialized program for converting <a href="http://www.linfo.org/source_code.html"><i>source code</i></a> into <a href="http://www.linfo.org/machine_code.html"><i>machine code</i></a> that a CPU can directly understand and execute. An <i>assembler</i> is a computer program for translating an <i>assembly language</i>
 into machine code. Source code is the original form in which software 
is written in a programming language prior to being compiled, and 
assembly languages are a type of <i>low level</i> (i.e., very close to machine code but easier for humans to read and write) programming language. 
</p>

<p>
The PDP-7 was well received in data acquisition and laboratory 
applications, and it was considered sufficiently reliable (at least when
 properly programmed) to be suitable even for use in the control of 
nuclear reactors. Ultimately, 120 of the systems were produced and sold.
</p>

<p><br>
<strong>The PDP-7 and the Birth of UNIX</strong>
</p>

<p>
In 1969 <a href="http://www.linfo.org/thompson.html">Ken Thompson</a> wrote the first version of UNIX in assembly language using an otherwise little-used PDP-7 at <a href="http://www.linfo.org/bell_labs.html">Bell Labs</a>, the research arm of AT&amp;T, the former U.S. telecommunications <a href="http://www.linfo.org/monopoly.html">monopoly</a>.
 One of the factors that made this possible was the proficiency that he 
had gained with that system while writing an early computer game called <i>Space Travel</i>. This game, incidentally, became one of the first programs to run on UNIX.
</p>

<p>
However, the PDP-7 was already obsolete when it was used for creating 
the first version of UNIX, and thus in 1970 the UNIX group proposed 
purchasing a PDP-11 for $65,000. The PDP-11, which had just been 
launched that year, incorporated some important advances (including 
greater ease of programming), and it became a highly successful and 
influential model. It was DEC's first and only 16-bit system. 
</p>

<p>
In 1971, the group used their new PDP-11 to rewrite UNIX in a <i>high-level</i> language, instead of its original assembly language, so that it could more easily be <i>ported to</i>
 (i.e., transferred to) other types of computers. They briefly tried 
using Fortran before creating their own language based on BCPL (Basic 
Combined Programming Language), which they called <i>B</i>. They then extended B to produce <a href="http://www.linfo.org/c.html">the <i>C</i> language</a>,
 which is still in widespread use today, after which they rewrote the 
UNIX source code in C. This made it easier to port UNIX to run on new 
hardware, as all that was needed was a C compiler to convert its C 
source code into the machine code for the specific type of computer.
</p>

<p>
The severe limitations of the PDP series and other computers of the day 
forced Thompson and Ritchie to be ruthlessly efficient in their designs 
for UNIX and C, as was the case with the other operating systems and 
languages of that era (although those other systems and languages have 
long since faded from use). Despite the fact that memory sizes, 
processor speeds, data access times, storage capacities and display 
capabilities have grown vastly greater than could have even been 
imagined at that time, this extreme efficiency has continued to serve <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html"><i>Unix-like</i></a> operating systems (i.e., the descendants and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/clone.html">clones</a>
 of the original UNIX) well and is widely acknowledged to be an 
important factor in the enduring and growing success of such systems. 
</p>

<p>
The PDP-15, which was shipped in 1970, was DEC's final 18-bit computer, 
and it was the only one that was implemented with integrated circuits 
rather than discrete components. It was the largest selling of all the 
PDP models, with more than 400 units ordered in just the first eight 
months of production. 
</p>

<p>
There are still a few PDP-7s in operable condition, including one that is currently being restored in Oslo, Norway.
