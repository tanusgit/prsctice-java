<p>
The <i>tar</i> (i.e., <i>tape archive</i>) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is used to convert a group of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filedef.html">files</a> into an <a href="http://www.linfo.org/archive.html"><i>archive</i></a>. 
</p>

<p>
An archive is a single file that contains any number of individual files
 plus information to allow them to be restored to their original form by
 one or more <i>extraction</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">programs</a>. Archives are convenient for storing files as well as for for transmitting <a href="http://www.linfo.org/data.html">data</a>
 and distributing programs. Moreover, they are very easy to work with, 
often much more so than dealing with large numbers of individual files. 
</p>

<p>
Although tar was originally designed for backups on magnetic tape, it can now be used to create archive files anywhere on a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filesystem.html">filesystem</a>. Archives that have been created with tar are commonly referred to as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/tarball.html"><i>tarballs</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
Unlike some other archiving programs, and consistent with the Unix 
philosophy that each individual program should be designed to do only 
one thing but do it well, tar does not perform <a href="http://www.linfo.org/data_compression.html">compression</a>. However, it is very easy to compress archives created with tar by using specialized compression utilities.
</p>

<p>
tar's basic syntax is
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tar option(s) archive_name file_name(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
tar has numerous options, many of which are not frequently used. Unlike many commands, tar requires the use of at least one <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">option</a>, and usually two or more are necessary.
</p>

<p>
tar files are created by using both the <i>-c</i> and <i>-f</i> options. The former instructs tar to create an archive and the latter indicates that the next <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>argument</i></a>
 (i.e., piece of input data in a command) will be the name of the new 
archive file. Thus, for example, the following would create an archive 
file called <i>file.tar</i> from the three files named <i>file1</i>, <i>file2</i> and <i>file3</i> that are located in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html">current directory</a> (i.e., the directory in which the user is currently working):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tar -cf file.tar file1 file2 file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It it not absolutely necessary that the new file have the <i>.tar</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filename_extension.html">extension</a>;
 however, the use of this extension can be is very convenient because it
 allows the type of file to be visually identified. It is necessary, 
however, that the -f option be the final option in a sequence of 
contiguous, single-letter options; otherwise, the system will become 
confused as to the desired name for the new file and will use the next 
option in the sequence as the name.
</p>

<p>
The <i>-v</i> (i.e., <i>verbose</i>) option is commonly used together 
with the -c and -f options in order to display a list of the files that 
are included in the archive. In such case, the above example would 
become
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tar -cvf file.tar file1 file2 file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
tar can also be used to make archives from the contents of one or more directories. The result is <i>recursive</i>; that is, it includes all <i>objects</i> (e.g., directories and files) within each level of directories. For example, the contents of two directories named <i>dir1</i> and <i>dir2</i> could be archived into a file named <i>dir.tar</i> with the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tar -cvf dir.tar dir1 dir2</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is often convenient to use tar with a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/wildcard.html"><i>wildcard</i></a> (i.e., a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">character</a> which can represent some specific class of characters or sequence of characters). The following example uses the <i>star wildcard</i> (i.e., an asterisk), which represents <i>any</i> character or sequence of characters, to create an archive of every object in the current directory:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tar -cf *</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By default, tar creates an archive of copies of the original files 
and/or directories, and the originals are retained. However, they can be
 removed when using tar by adding the <i>--remove-files</i> option. 
</p>

<p>
As it has no compression and decompression capabilities of its own, tar 
is commonly used in combination with an external compression utility. A 
very handy feature of the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gnu.html">GNU</a> version (which is standard on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a>)
 is the availability of options that will cause standard compression 
programs to compress a new archive file as soon as it has been created. 
They are <i>-j</i> (for <a href="http://www.linfo.org/bzip2.html"><i>bzip2</i></a>), <i>-z</i> (for <i>gzip</i>) and <i>-Z</i> (for <i>compress</i>). Thus, for example, the following would create an archive named <i>files.tar.bz2</i> of the files <i>file4</i>, <i>file5</i> and <i>file6</i> that is compressed using bzip2:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tar -cvjf files.tar.bz2 file4 file5 file6</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
tar can also be used for unpacking tar files. However, before doing 
this, there are several steps that should be taken. One is to confirm 
that sufficient space is available on the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/hdd.html">hard disk drive</a>
 (HDD). Another is to move to an empty directory (which usually involves
 creating one with an appropriate name) to prevent the reconstituted 
files from cluttering up the current directory and overwriting any files
 or directories with same names that are in it. In addition, if the 
archive has been compressed, it must first be decompressed using the 
appropriate decompression program (which can usually be determined by 
the filename extension).
</p>

<p>
In order to unpack a tar file, the <i>-x</i> (for <i>extract</i>) and -f
 options are required. It is also common to add the -v option to provide
 a running listing of the files being unpacked. Thus, for example, to 
unpack the archive file.tar created in a previous example the following 
would be used:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tar -xvf file.tar </code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Just as options are available to allow three compression programs to 
automatically compress newly created tar files, the same options can be 
used to have the compression programs automatically decompress tar files
 prior to extraction. Thus, for instance, the following would decompress
 and extract the contents of the compressed archive files.tar.bz2 that 
was created in an above example: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tar -xjvf files.tar.bz2 </code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Files can be added to an existing archive using the <i>-r</i> option. As is always the case with tar, it is also necessary to use the -f option to indicate that the following <a href="http://www.linfo.org/string.html"><i>string</i></a> (i.e., sequence of characters) is the name of the archive. For example, the following would append a file named <i>file7</i> to file.tar:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tar -rf file.tar file7</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>--delete</i> option allows specified files to be completely 
removed from a tar file (except when the tar file is on magnetic tape). 
However, this is different from an extraction, as copies of the removed 
files are not made and placed in the current directory. Thus, for 
example, the files file1 and file2 can be removed from file.tar with the
 following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tar -f file.tar --delete file1 file2</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>-t</i> option tells tar to list the contents of an uncompressed 
archive without performing an extraction. Thus, the following would list
 the contents of file.tar:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>tar -tf file.tar</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One of the very few options that can be used alone with tar is <i>--help</i>, which provides a relatively compact listing of the numerous options that are available. Another is <i>--version</i>, which shows the version number for the installed tar program as well as its copyright information.
