It is easy to insert text into an open file from another file. All that 
is necessary is to move the cursor to the location where you want the 
text inserted, then type

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>:r filename</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
where "filename" is the name of the file to insert. 
</p>

<p>
For example, if you want to copy the contents of the file "peach" into 
the file "fruit," you would first position the cursor to the desired 
line in "fruit" and then type</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>:r peach</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that this operation causes no change to the file "peach."
</p>


<p>You can also append text from the currently open file to any other file. This is accomplished  using the <b>:w</b> (colon + "w") command followed without a space by <b>&gt;&gt;</b>. For example, to append the contents of a currently open file named "pear" to the file named "apple," type  
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>:w&gt;&gt; apple</code>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>At times it can be convenient to open multiple files simultaneously. 
This is efficiently accomplished by just listing all of the files to be 
opened after the <b>vi</b> command. For example, to simultaneously open files about three kinds of fruit, type:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>vi apple pear orange</code>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
This allows you to edit "apple" first. After saving "apple," typing <code>:n</code> calls up "pear" for editing.

</p>

<p>If you want to simultaneously open all files in the current directory, just type <code>vi *</code> (vi + space + asterisk).   </p>
