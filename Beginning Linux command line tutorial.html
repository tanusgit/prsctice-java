<p>
The <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line.html"><i>command line</i></a> (i.e., all-text display mode) is a key part of any truly modern computer  <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating system</a><font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font>.
</p>

<p>
Because <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gui.html"><i>graphical user interfaces</i></a>
 (GUIs) have become very easy to use in the past decade or so, it is no 
longer common for most computer users to utilize the command line, 
especially for simple tasks such as word processing, searching the web 
and sending e-mail. Thus, the command line is frequently perceived as 
being unnecessary, intimidating and even obsolete. A GUI is a display 
mode that contains images, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/window.html"><i>windows</i></a> and menus and which is manipulated primarily with a mouse. 
</p>

<p>
However, the command line, also referred to as the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/shell.html"><i>shell</i></a> (although the shell is actually a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">program</a>
 the provides the command line), can be quite easy to learn and use, and
 its value soon becomes apparent after a little practice. Even a basic 
familiarity with it can make computers easier to use and facilitate 
performing tasks that might be difficult or impossible with a GUI. Such 
familiarity can also lead to an improved understanding of how computers 
actually work. 
</p>

<p>
Many people who are new to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> command line will be familiar with the command line used in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/ms-dos.html">MS-DOS</a>
 and think that the two are similar. However, the similarities are 
largely just superficial, and there are vast differences. The Linux 
command line is far more powerful (i.e., it is much more flexible and 
can do many more things), and in some ways it is much more <i>user friendly</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Studying the Linux command line provides an education in much more than 
just how to use a specific operating system. One reason is that the 
Linux command line is virtually identical to the command line used on 
every other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> operating system, e.g., Solaris, FreeBSD and Mac OS X. Thus, multiple operating systems are being learned simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
Studying the command line also provides insight into how computers 
really work. This is because the command line is much closer to the 
internal functioning of computers than are GUIs, which are generally 
just <i>front ends</i> for the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">commands</a>
 used on the command line. Moreover, the underlying commands typically 
have greater flexibility than their GUI counterparts, they can easily be
 combined with other commands, and they can be used in situations where a
 GUI is not available (e.g., making system repairs) or is not 
functioning properly. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Accessing the Command Line</strong>
</p>

<p>
A first step in learning about the command line is accessing it. Usually, the easiest way to do this is to open a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/terminal_window.html"><i>terminal window</i></a>, which is an all-text window in a GUI. This can be accomplished by merely clicking on the appropriate menu item or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/icon.html"><i>icon</i></a> (i.e., small image). For example, in the case of Red Hat Linux, all that is necessary is to select the item called <i>Terminal</i> which appears in the <i>System Tools</i> menu. On some <a href="http://www.linfo.org/distributions_list.html"><i>distributions</i></a> (i.e., versions) of Linux, a terminal window can be opened by clicking an appropriate icon that sits on the <i>toolbar</i> (i.e., strip of icons) along the bottom of the screen. 
</p>

<p>
Another way to open the command line is to switch to a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/console.html"><i>console</i></a>, which is a display mode in which the entire screen is text only and there are no buttons, windows or other GUI <i>objects</i>.
 The easiest way to accomplish this is to simultaneously press the CRTL,
 ALT and F1 keys while in a GUI. The GUI disappears and the entire 
screen becomes black except for a few white <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">characters</a> (which constitute the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/prompt.html"><i>command prompt</i></a>)
 in the upper left-hand corner. Fortunately, the GUI can be restored at 
any time on a typical system by simultaneously pressing the CTRL, ALT 
and F8 keys.
</p>

<p>
<strong>The pwd Command</strong>
</p>

<p>
A good first command to learn is <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pwd.html"><i>pwd</i></a>, which stands for <i>present working directory</i>. This command shows the name and location of the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html"><i>current directory</i></a>, which is the directory (also called a <i>folder</i>
 on some operating systems) in which the user is currently working. All 
that is necessary in order to use this command is to type the word <i>pwd</i> in at the keyboard as follows and then press the ENTER key:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>pwd</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the terminal window or console has just been opened, what will 
typically be shown on the next line on the monitor screen will be <a href="http://www.linfo.org/home.html"><i>/home</i></a>
 followed by another forward slash and then the name of the user's home 
directory (which is usually the same as the user name). For example, if 
the user has a user name of <i>john</i>, the line would say <i>/home/john</i>. This is because a user begins working at the command line in its <a href="http://www.linfo.org/home_directory.html"><i>home directory</i></a>, home directories are located in the directory named <i>/home</i>, and a user's home directory typically has the same name as the user name. 
</p>

<p>
Commands (and virtually everything else) in Unix-like operating systems are <i>case sensitive</i>, in contrast to MS-DOS, which is case <i>in</i>sensitive. That is, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/lower_case.html">lower case</a>
 and upper case letters are treated as completely different characters. 
Thus, for example, pwd must always be written in all lower case letters,
 not as <i>PWD</i> or <i>Pwd</i><font size="-1"><sup>2</sup></font>. 
</p>

<p>
pwd becomes more useful after the current directory has been changed a 
few times, because then the location and name of the current directory 
are not always as obvious. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>The ls Command</strong>
</p>

<p>
<i>ls</i> is another of the most basic and frequently used commands on Unix-like operating systems. It is equivalent to <i>DIR</i> on MS-DOS systems, and it lists the contents of a directory. When used just by itself, it provides a list of the names of the <i>objects</i> (i.e., files, directories and links) in the current directory, i.e., 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It can be seen that various names are listed but that no additional 
information is provided about them. This is often sufficient, but in 
many cases it is desired to obtain additional information about each 
directory object. Obtaining such information can be easily accomplished 
by using ls together with one or more of its <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html"><i>options</i></a>.
 An option is a letter (or in some cases a word) that follows the 
command after a space and that tells the command how to behave. Multiple
 options can usually be used together, and they are usually preceded 
directly by a hyphen (without any intervening space). The options 
available can differ substantially according to the specific command. 
</p>

<p>
For example, the <i>-a</i> option tells ls to show <i>all</i> objects in the directory, inclusive of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/hidden_file.html"><i>hidden files</i></a>
 or hidden directories. Hidden objects are those whose names are 
normally not visible either in the command line or when examining the 
contents of a directory in a GUI. Their names are preceded directly by a
 period, such as <i>.file1</i>. Thus to see the names of all objects in 
the current directory, the following command should be typed in and then
 the ENTER key pressed:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls -a</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Many commands have numerous options, and ls is no exception. However, 
typically only a few of them are frequently used. Another commonly 
employed option for ls is <i>-l</i>, which provides a <i>long</i> 
listing, i.e., it provides much information about each object in 
addition to just its name. This additional information includes the type
 of object (e.g., file, directory or link), its <i>permissions</i> (i.e., who has access to it for reading, writing and/or executing), its <i>owner</i> (which is by default the same as its creator), and the date and time of creation. 
</p>

<p>
When used together with both its -a and -l options, the command would be written as
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls -al</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another common option for ls is <i>-s</i>, which shows the size of each file (but not directory
<font size="-1"><sup>3</sup></font>) in kilo<a href="http://www.linfo.org/byte.html">bytes</a>. This option is often used together with the above two options as
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls -als</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Like most commands, but unlike pwd, ls can accept input data, which is referred to as an <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>argument</i></a>.
 In the case of ls, arguments are the names of directories about which 
it is desired to obtain information. Any number of directories can be 
listed as arguments. They all follow ls and any options, and they are 
separated by at least one blank space. 
</p>

<p>
For example, if it is desired to see the names of all the objects in both the directories <a href="http://www.linfo.org/bin.html"><i>/bin</i></a> and <i>/home</i>, the following command would be used:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls -a /bin /home</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As is the case with /home, /bin is a standard first tier directory in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root_directory.html"><i>root directory</i></a>,
 which is the single directory that contains all other directories and 
their subdirectories on a Unix-like operating system and which is 
represented by a forward slash ( / ). Like all other first-tier 
directories in the root directory, their names begin with a forward 
slash, in part so that they will not be confused with directories with 
similar names that are not first tier directories of the root directory.
 
</p>

<p>
<strong>The cd Command</strong>
</p>

<p>
The last of what are perhaps the three most basic commands on Unix-like operating systems is <i>cd</i>, which is used to change the current directory. This is equivalent to the CD and CHDIR commands in MS-DOS. 
</p>

<p>
Thus, for example, to change the current directory to the /bin directory, the following would be used:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cd /bin</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, to change to the root directory, the following would be used:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cd /</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Any user can return to its home directory by using a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/tilde.html"><i>tilde</i></a>
 as the argument for cd. A tilde is a short, wavy, horizontal line that 
represents the home directory of the current user, and this character is
 located in the upper left hand corner on most standard English language
 keyboards. That is, any user can return immediately to its home 
directory by typing the following and then pressing the ENTER key:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cd ~</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is easier than typing the full name of the user's home directory as an argument, for example <i>/home/josephine</i> in the case of a user named <i>josephine</i>. It is just one of the numerous shortcuts that help make the command line on Unix-like operating systems so easy to use<font size="-1"><sup>4</sup></font>.

________
<br>
<font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font>Microsoft downgraded the command line
 in its operating systems subsequent to Microsoft Windows 95 in an 
attempt to allow virtually all operations to be performed in the GUI. 
However, this has not been successful in the opinion of many computer 
experts, and the company has thus been developing a command line (code 
named <i>Monad</i>) similar to those in Unix-like systems for use in its future operating systems.
</p>

<p>
<font size="-1"><sup>2</sup></font> For purposes of clarity and 
consistency, the case of commands, keywords, etc. that are always 
written in lower case is maintained when discussing them in text in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linfo.html">The Linux Information Project</a>, even when they are used at the beginning of sentences or in titles (although this may at first appear odd or even erroneous).
</p>

<p>
<font size="-1"><sup>3</sup></font> In Unix-like operating systems 
everything is considered to be a file, and that includes directories, 
which are just a special type of file. However, there are some 
differences in behavior, of which this is an example.
</p>

<p>
<font size="-1"><sup>4</sup></font> Among the others are <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_completion.html"><i>command completion</i></a>, which is the automatic completion of the names of commands and their arguments that have only partially been typed by a user, <i>command history</i>, which allows the user to view, edit and reissue previously executed commands, and <i>wildcards</i>, which can represent any group of files and directories.
