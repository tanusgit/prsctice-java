The <i>df</i> (i.e., <i>disk free</i>) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> reports the amount of space used and available on currently <a href="http://www.linfo.org/mounting.html"><i>mounted</i></a> (i.e., logically attached to the system) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filesystem.html"><i>filesystems</i></a>. 
</p>

<p>
A filesystem is a hierarchy of directories. Although everything mounted on a computer running <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> or another <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating system</a> resides logically in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root_directory.html"><i>root directory</i></a>
 (i.e., the top directory in the hierarchy of directories on a 
computer), on a typical installation some filesystems will be physically
 located on different <a href="http://www.linfo.org/partition.html"><i>partitions</i></a> (i.e., a logically independent section of a hard disk drive) or on other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/storage.html">storage</a> <i>devices</i> such as a CDROM, floppy disk or a USB (universal <a href="http://www.linfo.org/serial_port.html">serial</a> bus) key drive, or even on another computer located elsewhere on a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/network.html">network</a>.
</p>

<p>
df is commonly used to show not only the space available and used but 
also what filesystems are mounted, when capacity has been reached on a 
partition or other device, the number of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/inode.html"><i>inodes</i></a> still available, and whether there is sufficient space on a partition to upgrade an existing <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">program</a> or to install a new program. 
</p>

<p>
The basic syntax for df is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>df [option(s)] [device(s)]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The items in square brackets are optional. When used with no <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a> and no <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>arguments</i></a> (i.e., input files), df generates a table that lists for each device its name, its size in one-kilo<a href="http://www.linfo.org/byte.html">byte</a> blocks, the number of kilobyte blocks used, the number of kilobyte blocks available, the percentage of blocks used and the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/mount_point.html"><i>mount point</i></a> (i.e., the directory in which it is mounted). 
</p>

<p>
When a device is provided as an argument, df will report data only for 
the filesystem physically residing on that device. If multiple devices 
are provided, the data will be reported for each listed device. Thus, 
for example, the following will provide information only for the 
partition (or other device) that contains the root directory: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>df /</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A device can be provided as an argument by using either its device name or its <a href="http://www.linfo.org/absolute_pathname.html"><i>absolute pathname</i></a>
 (i.e., its full path of directories relative to the root directory). 
Thus, for example, if the root directory  (which is represented by a 
forward slash) resides on the third partition of the HDD (or on the 
third partition of the first HDD on a computer with multiple HDDs), 
whose device name is <i>/dev/hda3</i>, then the same result would be obtained by using the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>df /dev/hda3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For many users, df's most useful option is <i>-h</i>, which tells it to express its output in <i>human readable</i> form. That is, it reports device sizes in megabytes and gigabytes as appropriate and appends the data with the letters <i>M</i> and <i>G</i>, respectively. The <i>-m</i> option tells df to report its data in one-megabyte (i.e., 1,048,576 bytes) blocks, and the <i>-k</i> option tells it to use one-kilobyte blocks (the default, but which is available as an option anyway).
</p>

<p>
The <i>-i</i> option instructs df to list inode usage instead of block usage. An inode is a <i>data structure</i> on a filesystem on a Unix-like operating system that stores all the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/information.html">information</a> about a named file, directory or other <i>filesystem object</i> except its name and its actual data (i.e., all of its <a href="http://www.linfo.org/metadata.html"><i>metadata</i></a> except for its name). A data structure is an efficient way of storing data. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>-a</i> (i.e., <i>all</i>) option tells df to include in its 
output filesystems that have a size of zero blocks, which are omitted by
 default. Such filesystems are typically special-purpose 
pseudo-filesystems, such as those for automatic device mounting use. 
</p>

<p>
The -T option instructs df to add to its report the <i>type</i> of each filesystem listed (e.g., <i>ext2</i>, <i>ext3</i>, <i>vfat</i> or <i>iso9660</i>). The types reported are the same as those that can be included or excluded with the <i>-t</i> (i.e., <i>type</i>) and <i>-x</i> (i.e., <i>exclude</i>) options, respectively.
</p>

<p>
The <i>--help</i> option displays a brief help message and then exits. The <i>--version</i> option reports which version of df is currently installed. In contrast to many <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line.html"><i>command line</i></a> (i.e., all-text mode) programs, the <i>-v</i> option does not provide version information; it is merely ignored and does not produce an error message.
</p>

<p>
df's output data is not precise, and it can conflict with that provided by the<a href="http://www.linfo.org/du.html"><i> du</i></a> (i.e., <i>disk usage</i>)
 command, whose results likewise might not be exact. However, it is 
still a very useful command, and in many cases it is faster and more 
convenient than du.
