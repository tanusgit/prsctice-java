The vi editor was developed starting around 1976 by Bill Joy, who was 
then a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley. Joy
 later went on to help found  Sun Microsystems and became its Chief 
Scientist. 
</p>

<p>
"ed" was the original Unix text editor. Like other early text editors, 
it was line oriented and used from dumb printing terminals. Joy first 
developed "ex" as an improved line editor that supported a superset of 
ed commands. He then developed vi  as a "visual interface" to ex. That 
is, it  allows text to be viewed on a full screen rather than only one 
line at a time. vi takes its name from this fact.  </p>

<p>vi remains very popular today in spite of the development and 
widespread availability of GUI (graphical user interface) mode text 
editors which are far more intuitive and much easier for beginners to 
use than text-mode text editors such as vi. GUI-mode text editors 
include gedit and Emacs, both of which have become very common on Linux 
and other Unixes today.
