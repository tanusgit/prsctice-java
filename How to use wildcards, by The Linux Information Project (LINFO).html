<p>
A <i>wildcard</i> is a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">character</a>
 that can be used as a substitute for any of a class of characters in a 
search, thereby greatly increasing the flexibility and efficiency of 
searches.  
</p>

<p>
Wildcards are commonly used in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/shell.html"><i>shell</i></a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">commands</a> in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> and other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_system.html">operating systems</a>. A shell is a program that provides a text-only <a href="http://www.linfo.org/user_interface.html">user interface</a> and whose main function is to execute commands typed in by users and display their results.
</p>

<p>
Wildcards are also used in <i>regular expressions</i> and programming languages. Regular expressions are a pattern matching system that uses <a href="http://www.linfo.org/string.html"><i>strings</i></a> (i.e., sequences of characters) constructed according to pre-defined syntax rules to find desired strings in text. 
</p>

<p>
The term <i>wildcard</i> or <i>wild card</i> was originally used in card
 games to describe a card that can be assigned any value that its holder
 desires. However, its usage has spread so that it is now used to 
describe an unknown or unpredictable factor in a variety of fields.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Star Wildcard</strong>
</p>

<p>
Three types of wildcards are used with Linux commands. The most frequently employed and usually the most useful is the <i>star wildcard</i>,
 which is the same as an asterisk (*). The star wildcard has the 
broadest meaning of any of the wildcards, as it can represent zero 
characters, all single characters or any string.
</p>

<p>
As an example, the <i>file</i> command provides information about any <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filesystem.html">filesystem</a> object (i.e., <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filedef.html">file</a>, directory or link) that is provided to it as an <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>argument</i></a>
 (i.e., input). Because the star wildcard represents every string, it 
can be used as the argument for file to return information about every 
object in the specified directory. Thus, the following would display 
information about every object in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html"><i>current directory</i></a> (i.e., the directory in which the user is currently working):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>file *</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If there are no matches, an error message is returned, such as <i>*: can't stat `*' (No such file or directory).</i>. In the case of this example, the only way that there would be no matches is if the directory were empty.
</p>

<p>
Wildcards can be combined with other characters to represent parts of 
strings. For example, to represent any filesystem object that has a <i>.jpg</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filename_extension.html">filename extension</a>, <i>*.jpg</i> would be used. Likewise, <i>a*</i> would represent all objects that begin with a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/lower_case.html"><i>lower case</i></a> (i.e., small) letter <i>a</i>. 
</p>

<p>
As another example, the following would tell the <i>ls</i> command (which is used to list files) to provide the names of all files in the current directory that have an <i>.html</i> or a <i>.txt</i> extension:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls *.html *.txt</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, the following would tell the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/rm.html"><i>rm</i></a> command (which is used to remove files and directories) to delete all files in the current directory that have the string <i>xxx</i> in their name:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rm *xxx*</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<br>
<p>
<strong>Question Mark Wildcard</strong>
</p>

<p>
The question mark (?) is used as a wildcard character in shell commands 
to represent exactly one character, which can be any single character. 
Thus, two question marks in succession would represent any two 
characters in succession, and three question marks in succession would 
represent any string consisting of three characters.
</p>

<p>
Thus, for example, the following would return data on all objects in the
 current directory whose names, inclusive of any extensions, are exactly
 three characters in length:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>file ???</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And the following would provide data on all objects whose names are one, two or three characters in length:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>file ? ?? ???</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As is the case with the star wildcard, the question mark wildcard can be
 used in combination with other characters. For example, the following 
would provide information about all objects in the current directory 
that begin with the letter <i>a</i> and are five characters in length:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>file a????</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The question mark wildcard can also be used in combination with other 
wildcards when separated by some other character. For example, the 
following would return a list of all files in the current directory that
 have a three-character filename extension:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls *.???</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<br>
<p>
<strong>Square Brackets Wildcard</strong>
</p>

<p> 
The third type of wildcard in shell commands is a pair of square 
brackets, which can represent any of the characters enclosed in the 
brackets. Thus, for example, the following would provide information 
about all objects in the current directory that have an x, y and/or z in
 them: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>file *[xyz]*</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And the following would list all files that had an extension that begins with x, y or z:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls *.[xyz]*</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The same results can be achieved by merely using the star and question 
mark wildcards. However, it is clearly more efficient to use the bracket
 wildcard.
</p>

<p>
When a hyphen is used between two characters in the square brackets 
wildcard, it indicates a range inclusive of those two characters. For 
example, the following would provide information about all of the 
objects in the current directory that begin with any letter from <i>a</i> through <i>f</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>file [a-f]*</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And the following would provide information about every object in the 
current directory whose name includes at least one numeral:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>file *[0-9]*</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The use of the square brackets to indicate a range can be combined with 
its use to indicate a list. Thus, for example, the following would 
provide information about all filesystem objects whose names begin with 
any letter from <i>a</i> through <i>c</i> or begin with <i>s</i> or <i>t</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>file [a-cst]*</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, multiple sets of ranges can be specified. Thus, for instance, 
the following would return information about all objects whose names 
begin with the first three or the final three lower case letters of the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/alphabet.html">alphabet</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>file [a-cx-z]*</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sometimes it can be useful to have a succession of square bracket 
wildcards. For example, the following would display all filenames in the
 current directory that consist of <i>jones</i> followed by a three-digit number:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls jones[0-9][0-9][0-9]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
