<p>
The <i>chown</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is used to change the <i>owner</i> and <i>group</i> of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/file.html">files</a>, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/directory.html">directories</a> and links.
</p>

<p>
By default, the owner of a <i>filesystem object</i> is the user that created it. The group is a set of users that share the same <a href="http://www.linfo.org/permissions.html">access permissions</a> (i.e., read, write and execute) for that object.
</p>

<p>
The basic syntax for using chown to change owners is
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>chown [options] new_owner object(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>new_owner</i> is the user name or the numeric <a href="http://www.linfo.org/uid.html">user ID</a> (UID) of the new owner, and <i>object</i> is the name of the target file,  directory or link. The ownership of any number of objects can be changed simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
For example, the following would transfer the ownership of a file named <i>file1</i> and a directory named <i>dir1</i> to a new owner named <i>alice</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>chown alice file1 dir1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In order to perform the above command, most systems are configured by default to require access to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root.html"><i>root</i></a> (i.e., system administrator) account, which can be obtained on a personal computer by using the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/su.html"><i>su</i></a> (i.e., <i>substitute user</i>)
 command. An error message will be returned in the event that the user 
does not have the proper permissions or that the specified new owner or 
target(s) does not exist (or is spelled incorrectly). 
</p>

<p>
The ownership and group of a filesystem object can be confirmed by using the <i>ls</i> command with its <i>-l</i> (i.e., <i>long</i>)
 option. The owner is shown in the third column and the group in the 
fourth. Thus, for example, the owner and group of file1 can be seen by 
using the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls -l file1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The basic syntax for using chown to change groups is
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>chown [options] :new_group object(s)</code>
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
or
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>chown [options] .new_group object(s)</code>
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
The only difference between the two versions is that the name or numeric
 ID of the new group is preceded directly by a colon in the former and 
by a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/dot.html">dot</a> in the latter; there is no functional difference. In this case, chown performs the same function as the <i>chgrp</i> (i.e., <i>change group</i>) command.
</p>

<p>
The owner and group can be changed simultaneously by combining the 
syntaxes for changing owner and group. That is, the name or UID of the 
new owner is followed directly (i.e., with no intervening spaces) by a 
period or colon, which is followed directly by the name or numeric ID of
 the new group, which, in turn, is followed by a space and then by the 
names of the target files, directories and/or links. 
</p>

<p>
Thus, for example, the following would change the owner of a file named <i>file2</i> to the user with the user name <i>bob</i> and change its group to <i>group2</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>chown bob:group2 file2</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If a user name or UID is followed directly by a colon or dot but no 
group name is provided, then the group is changed to that user's login 
group. Thus, for example, the following would change the ownership of <i>file3</i> to <i>cathy</i>
 and would also change that file's group to the login group of the new 
owner (which by default is usually the same as the new owner):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>chown cathy: file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Among chown's few <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a> is <i>-R</i>, which operates on filesystem objects <i>recursively</i>. That is, when used on a directory, it can change the ownership and/or group of all objects within the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/directory_tree.html">directory tree</a> beginning with that directory rather than just the ownership of the directory itself. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>-v</i> (verbose) option provides information about every object processed. The <i>-c</i> is similar, but reports only when a change is made. The <i>--help</i> option displays the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/documentation.html">documentation</a> found in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/man.html"><i>man</i></a> online manual, and the <i>--version</i> option outputs version information.
