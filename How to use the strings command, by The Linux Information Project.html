The <i>strings</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> returns each <a href="http://www.linfo.org/string.html"><i>string</i></a> of <i>printable characters</i> in files. Its main uses are to determine the contents of and to extract text from <a href="http://www.linfo.org/binary.html">binary</a> files (i.e., non-text files). 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">Characters</a> are the 
basic symbols that are used to  write or print a language. For example, 
the characters used by the English language consist of the letters of 
the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/alphabet.html">alphabet</a>, numerals,
 punctuation marks and a variety of symbols (e.g., the ampersand, the 
dollar sign and the arithmetic symbols). Printable characters are those 
which actually display on a monitor screen, as opposed to those that 
perform other functions, such as indicating a new line or a tab. A 
string is any finite sequence of characters, and it can be as few as one
 character. 
</p>


<p>
The basic syntax of the strings command is
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>strings [options] file_name(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When used without any <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a>, strings displays all strings that are at least four characters in length in the files whose names are supplied as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html">arguments</a>
 (i.e., input data). Strings that are on separate lines in the input 
files are shown on separate lines on the screen, and an attempt is made 
to display all strings found on a single line in a file on a single line
 on the screen (although there may be a carryover to subsequent lines in
 the event that numerous strings are found on a single line).
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most commonly used of strings's few options is <i>-n</i>, 
which, when followed by an integer, tells it to return strings which are
 at least the number of that integer in length. For example, the 
following would display all strings in the files named <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> that consist of at least two characters: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>strings -n 2 file1 file2</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>-t</i> option tells strings to also return the offset position 
for each line on which one or more strings are found. This option is 
followed by a letter indicating the numbering system to be used, i.e., <i>o</i> for octal, <i>d</i> for decimal and <i>x</i> for <a href="http://www.linfo.org/hexadecimal.html">hexadecimal</a>. Each printing character, each space and the start of each new line add one to the count. Thus, for example, for a file named <i>file3</i> which contains the string <i>abcd</i> followed by a single space and then by the string <i>efghi</i> on the first line and the string <i>jklm</i>
 on the second line, the following command would return the number 0 
before the strings in the first line and the number 11 before the string
 in the second line: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>strings -t d file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>-f</i> option tells strings to begin each line of its output with
 the name of the file from which it is returning a particular string, 
followed by a colon and then by several spaces. This can be useful when 
simultaneously searching for strings in multiple files.
