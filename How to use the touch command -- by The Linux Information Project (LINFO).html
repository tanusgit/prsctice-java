The <i>touch</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is the easiest way to create new, empty <a href="http://www.linfo.org/file.html">files</a>. It is also used to change the <i>timestamps</i> (i.e., dates and times of the most recent access and modification) on existing files and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/directory.html">directories</a>.
</p>

<p>
touch's syntax is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>touch [option] file_name(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When used without any <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a>, touch creates new files for any file names that are provided as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>arguments</i></a> (i.e., input data) if files with such names do not already exist. Touch can create any number of files simultaneously. 
</p>

<p>
Thus, for example, the following command would create three new, empty files named <i>file1</i>, <i>file2</i> and <i>file3</i>: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>touch file1 file2 file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A nice feature of touch is that, in contrast to some commands such as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/cp.html"><i>cp</i></a> (which is used to copy files and directories) and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/mv.html"><i>mv</i></a>
 (which is used to move or rename files and directories), it does not 
automatically overwrite (i.e., erase the contents of) existing files 
with the same name. Rather, it merely changes the last access times for 
such files to the current time. 
</p>

<p>
Several of touch's options are specifically designed to allow the user to change the timestamps for files. For example, the <i>-a</i> option changes only the access time, while the <i>-m</i>
 option changes only the modification time. The use of both of these 
options together changes both the access and modification times to the 
current time, for example: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>touch -am file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>-r</i> (i.e., <i>reference</i>) option followed directly by a 
space and then by a file name tells touch to use that file's time stamps
 instead of current time. For example, the following would tell it to 
use the times of <i>file4</i> for <i>file5</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>touch -r file4 file5</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>-B</i> option modifies the timestamps by going back the specified number of seconds, and the <i>-F</i> option modifies the time by going forward the specified number of seconds. For example, the following command would make <i>file7</i> 30 seconds older than <i>file6</i>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>touch <i>-r</i> file6 -B 30 file7</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>-d</i> and <i>-t</i> options allow the user to add a specific last access time. The former is followed by a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/string.html"><i>string</i></a>
 (i.e., sequence of characters) in the date, month, year, minute:second 
format, and the latter uses a [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] format. For example,
 to change the last access time of <i>file8</i> to 10:22 a.m. May 1, 2005, <i>1 May 2005 10:22</i> would be enclosed in single quotes and used as follows, i.e.,:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>touch -d '1 May 2005 10:22' file8</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Partial date-time strings can be used. For example, only the date need be provided, as shown for <i>file9</i> below (in which case the time is automatically set to 0:00): 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>touch -d '14 May' file9</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Just providing the time, as shown below, automatically changes the date to the current date:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>touch -d '14:24' file9</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The most commonly used way to view the last modification date for files is to use the <i>ls</i> command with its <i>-l</i> option. For example, in the case of a file named <i>file10</i> this would be
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls -l file10</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The complete timestamps for any file or directory can be viewed by using the <i>stat</i> command. For example, the following would show the timestamps for a file named <i>file11</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>stat file11</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>--help</i> option displays a basic list of options, and the <i>--version</i> option returns the version of the currently installed touch program.
