<p>
The <i>file</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> attempts to classify each <i>filesystem object</i> (i.e., <a href="http://www.linfo.org/file.html">file</a>, directory or link) that is provided to it as an <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html">argument</a>
 (i.e., input). Thus, it can usually provide immediate information as to
 whether some specified object is, for example, a GIF89a image file, a 
directory, a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gnu.html">GNU</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/tar.html">tar</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/archive.html">archive</a>, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/ascii.html">ASCII</a> English text, a symbolic link, an HTML document, an empty file, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/bzip2.html">bzip2</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/data_compression.html">compressed data</a>, an ELF 32-bit LSB <a href="http://www.linfo.org/executable.html">executable</a>, etc.
</p>

<p>
file accomplishes this by probing each object with three types of tests until one succeeds. The first is a <i>filesystem test</i>, which uses the <i>stat</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/system_call.html">system call</a> to obtain information from the object's <a href="http://www.linfo.org/inode.html"><i>inode</i></a> (which contains information about a file). A system call is a request in a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_system.html">operating system</a> for a service performed by the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/kernel.html"><i>kernel</i></a> (i.e., the core of the operating system). 
</p>

<p>
The second test checks to see if there is a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/magic_number.html"><i>magic number</i></a>, which is a number embedded at or near the beginning of many types of files that indicates the <i>file format</i> (i.e., the type of file).
</p>

<p>
In the event that the first two tests fail to determine the type of a file, <i>language tests</i> are employed to determine if it is <a href="http://www.linfo.org/plain_text.html"><i>plain text</i></a> (i.e., composed entirely of human-readable <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">characters</a>), and, if so, what type of plain text, such as HTML (hypertext markup language) or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/source_code.html"><i>source code</i></a> (i.e., the original version of a program as written by a human). In this situation, file also attempts to determine the <i>natural language</i> (e.g., English, Turkish or Japanese) that is used in the file.
</p>

<p>
A simplified version of file's syntax is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>file [option(s)] object_name(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
file has several <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a>, but it is most commonly used without any of them. For example, information about a file named <i>file1</i> that is located in the in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html"><i>current directory</i></a>
 (i.e., the directory in which the user is currently working) could be 
obtained by merely typing the following and pressing the RETURN key:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>file file1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Information about the types of <i>all</i> of the files in the current directory can be obtained by using the star <a href="http://www.linfo.org/wildcard.html"><i>wildcard</i></a> to represent every object in that directory as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>file *</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, information about all of the files in another directory can be
 obtained by using that directory as an argument and following it 
immediately by a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/forward_slash.html">forward slash</a> and the star wildcard. For example, the following classifies all of the objects in the <i>/boot</i> directory:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>file /boot/*</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The square brackets wildcard can be used together with the star wildcard
 to show the file types for only those objects whose names begin with 
specified letters or with a specified range of letters. For example, the
 following would show only those objects in the current directory whose 
names begin with letters <i>a</i> through <i>g</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>file [a-g]*</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>-k</i> option tells file to not stop at the first successful 
test, but to keep going; this can result in the reporting of additional 
information about some filesystem objects. The <i>-b</i> (i.e., <i>brief</i>)
 option tells file to not prepend filenames to output lines, which can 
be useful when compiling statistics about file types. The <i>-v</i> option returns information about the version of file that is installed.
