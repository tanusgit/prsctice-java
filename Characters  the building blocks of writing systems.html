<table width="520" align="center"><tbody><tr><td>



<p>
<i>Characters</i> are the basic symbols that are used to  write or print
 a language. For example, the characters used by the English language 
consist of the letters of the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/alphabet.html"><i>alphabet</i></a>, numerals, punctuation marks and a variety of symbols (e.g., the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/ampersand.html">ampersand</a>, the dollar sign and the arithmetic symbols). 
</p>

<p>
Characters are fundamental to <a href="http://www.linfo.org/computer.html">computer</a>
 systems. They are used for (1) input (e.g., through the keyboard or 
through optical scanning) and output (e.g., on the screen or on printed 
pages), (2) writing <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">programs</a> in programming languages, (3) as the basis of some <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_system.html">operating systems</a> (such as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a>) which are largely collections of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/plain_text.html"><i>plain text</i></a> (i.e., human-readable character) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/file.html">files</a> and (4) for the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/storage.html">storage</a> and transmission of non-character data (e.g., the transmission of images by e-mail using <i>base64</i>). 
</p>

<p>
Issues regarding characters and their use with computers are relatively 
simple if dealing with a single language, such as English, which has a 
small number of characters. However, they become quite complex when 
dealing with <a href="http://www.linfo.org/internationalization.html"><i>internationalization</i></a> and <i>localization</i>
 because of the diverse array of writing systems and vast number of 
characters in use throughout the world. Internationalization is the 
addition of a framework for support for multiple languages and cultures;
 localization is the adjustment of language, content and design to 
specific countries, regions or cultures. 
</p>


<p><br>
<strong>Character Sets</strong>
</p>

<p>
A <i>character set</i> is the collection of characters that is used to 
write a particular language. Most languages have a single character set,
 and similar character sets are often used by a number of languages 
(e.g., variants of the Roman alphabet are used to write English, 
Spanish, Finnish, Dutch, etc.).
</p>

<p>
A few languages have, or have had, more than one character set. For 
example, the Japanese language uses three character sets: the main one 
is <i>Chinese characters</i> (i.e., the characters that are used to write the Chinese language), but it is supplemented with two <i>syllabaries</i> (called <i>hiragana</i> and <i>katakana</i>). The Korean language is now written mainly with a unique alphabet (called <i>Hangul</i>), but Chinese characters are still occasionally used. 
</p>

<p>
Mongolia is attempting to restore its traditional alphabet that was replaced by the <i>Cyrillic alphabet</i>
 (used to write Russian) in 1937 as a result of the country's being 
incorporated into the Soviet Union, and thus both character sets are 
currently in use. Turkey used an Arabic alphabet until 1928, at which 
time it was replaced by an alphabet based on the Roman alphabet as part 
of a political decision to become more <i>westernized</i>.
</p>

<p><br>
<strong>Characters and Glyphs</strong>
</p>

<p>
Characters should not confused with <i>glyphs</i> (although they sometimes are). A glyph is a visual representation (i.e., appearance) of a character and is determined by the <i>typeface</i> and <i>style</i>
  in which the character is printed. In general, any character can have a
 number of glyphs, with the number depending on the language.
</p>

<p>
A typeface is a specific, coordinated design for the entire set of 
characters that is used to write a language or languages. Some typefaces
 are available in several styles, such as most of those used to write 
English and other Western European languages, which are usually 
available in plain, bold and italic.
</p>

<p>
Different writing systems use different typefaces, and the number of 
typefaces varies according to the writing system and language. Thousands
 of typefaces have been developed for use by English and other Western 
European languages, and they range all the way from the very simple <i>sans serif</i>
 Geneva and Courier (which was widely used for typewriters) to Times 
(which is frequently used in printing periodicals and books) to the 
highly ornate Gothic (which is used mainly for decorative purposes). 
Characters written in sans serif typefaces lack the little hooks on 
their ends that are widely believed to make them easier to read.
</p>

<p>
Some characters in some languages can look very different according to 
the combination of typeface and style that are used to write them, and 
in some cases they may closely resemble other characters. Yet, it is 
only the glyph of a character that resembles another character, and the 
character itself (including its meaning and usage) is distinct. 
</p>


<p><br>
<strong>Classification of Characters</strong>
</p>

<p>
Most writing systems can be broadly classified into one of three categories: <i>alphabetic</i>, <i>syllabic</i> and <i>logographic</i>. The vast majority of written languages that exist today use alphabets.</p>

<p>
An alphabet is the complete, ordered, standardized set of <i>letters</i> that is used to write or print a written language. Each letter represents one or more <i>phonemes</i>
 (i.e., the fundamental sounds of a spoken language) and/or is used in 
combination with other letters to represent a phoneme. Most alphabets in
 use today are based on the Roman alphabet, which was used by the 
ancient Romans to write their Latin language.
</p>

<p>
A syllabary is a set of characters that represent the <i>syllables</i> of a language, with one distinct character for each possible <i>syllable</i>.
 A syllable is the next largest unit of sound in a language after a 
phoneme; it consists of a vowel sound or a vowel-consonant combination. 
Syllabaries typically contain many more characters than do alphabets. 
They are best suited to languages with relatively simple syllable 
structures, such as Japanese, which has only about a hundred syllables. 
The English language, in contrast, contains a relatively large number of
 vowels and complex consonant clusters, resulting in thousands of 
syllables. 
</p>

<p>
The third major type of writing system, logographic, uses characters 
that represent objects or abstract ideas. This type of writing system is
 popularly referred to as <i>pictographic</i> or <i>ideographic</i>. The
 most important modern logographic writing system by far is Chinese, 
whose characters are also used, with varying degrees of modification, in
 Japanese and Korean (as a supplement to Hangul). The ancient Sumerians,
 Egyptians and Mayans also used logographic systems.
</p>

<p>
These three categories are not rigid. For example, the Chinese writing 
system is not purely logographic. This is because individual characters 
are often compounds which consist of an element that represents the 
meaning and an element that represents the pronunciation. Also, 
combinations of characters are sometimes used mainly for their phonetic 
values to represent proper nouns (e.g., names of people or places) from 
other languages.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, alphabetic and syllabic scripts frequently make some use of 
logograms and logographic values. The most common example is <a href="http://www.linfo.org/arabic_numerals.html"><i>Arabic numerals</i></a>,
 each of which has the same meaning regardless of which language or 
dialect it is used in and how it is pronounced. Other examples are 
symbols such as the ampersand and dollar sign. Also, individual letters 
sometimes have more than just a phonetic value: for example, in the 
English language the letter <i>A</i> often indicates high quality and the letter <i>X</i> sometimes indicates the unknown or an adult rating. 
</p>

<p><br>
<strong>Origin of Characters</strong>
</p>

<p>
The oldest known writing system is <i>cuneiform</i> (named after the 
wedge-like shapes of the characters that were formed in clay tablets 
with reed styluses), which emerged in Sumer (in the southern part of 
what is now Iraq) more than 5,000 years ago. It was followed closely by 
the development of writing in Egypt and the Indus valley (in western 
India). 
</p>

<p>
Chinese characters were apparently invented independently of characters 
used in the Middle East. They first appeared more than three thousand 
years ago, and they have been in use continuously in basically the same 
form ever since.
</p>

<p>
Most scholars believe that the first alphabets originated in the Near 
East, perhaps evolving from, or at least being influenced by, cuneiform 
or Egyptian hieroglyphics. The first widely used alphabet appears to 
have been that of the Phoenicians (who originated in what is now 
Lebanon), which was in use by at least 1,200 BC. That alphabet contained
 22 letters for consonant sounds and had no letters for vowels (as is 
the case with the Hebrew and Arabic alphabets, which descended from it).
 The Phoenicians spread their alphabet around the Mediterranean, 
including to the Greeks and the Etruscans (who preceded the Romans in 
Italy).
</p>

<p>
The Roman alphabet was adapted mainly from the Etruscan alphabet during the 7th century BC. It had only <i>upper case</i>
 (i.e., capital) letters and there were no punctuation marks nor spaces 
between words. Numbers were written with seven letters of the alphabet 
(i.e., <i>Roman numerals</i>) rather than with Arabic numerals.
</p>

<p>
Arabic numerals are today by far the most commonly used characters to 
represent numbers, although there are also other systems for writing 
numerals that are still in use, including Chinese and Thai. Arabic 
numerals were originally derived from an Indian system of writing 
numerals, and there is some speculation that the Indian numerals, in 
turn, originally came from Chinese characters.
</p>

<p>
Characters were also invented apparently independently in the Americas. 
In particular, the Mayans had a highly developed writing system that 
contained a large number of complex, logographic characters.
</p>

<p><br>
<strong>Numbers of Characters</strong>
</p>

<p>
The size of a character set varies wildly according to the language. 
Languages written with alphabets usually have the fewest characters and 
those using logographic writing systems have the most. Among the former,
 the language with the smallest alphabet (and thus the smallest total 
number of characters) is the Rotokas language (spoken in Bougainville, 
an island to the East of Papua New Guinea), which contains only eleven 
letters, and that with the largest alphabet is Armenian, with 39 
letters.  
</p>

<p>
The Chinese language has by far the largest number of characters of any 
writing system that has ever existed, and it accounts for the vast bulk 
of the characters in use in the world today. Chinese contains more than 
40,000 characters, and some estimates place the total at close to 
60,000. However, most of these are rarely used, and well-educated people
 generally know only about 5,000. 
</p>

<p>
The Japanese language ranks second in terms of the number of characters 
because it makes heavy use of Chinese characters. Approximately 2000 
such characters are taught during primary and secondary school, and a 
well-educated person will know at least 3500 characters. Hiragana and 
katakana, the two syllabaries that are used to supplement the Chinese 
characters, each contain 46 characters. 
</p>

<p>
In South Korea, middle and high school students study 1,800 to 2,000 
Chinese characters, but most people use Hangul almost exclusively in 
their daily lives. Chinese characters are used mainly for personal and 
place names, for calligraphy and for clarification of some terms written
 in Hangul.
</p>

<p><br>
<strong>Characters and Computers</strong>
</p>

<p>
The vast number of characters and the great diversity of writing systems
 in use around the world present some major challenges for the 
development of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/software.html">software</a>.
 This has become an increasingly important issue as a result of the 
rapid growth in the use of computers in countries that do not use 
European languages.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.linfo.org/ascii.html">ASCII</a> (an acronym for American Standard Code for Information Interchange and pronounced <i>ask-ee</i>)
 is the de facto encoding (i.e., set of code numbers) used by computers 
and communications equipment to represent text. It is a single <a href="http://www.linfo.org/byte.html"><i>byte</i></a> (i.e., eight <a href="http://www.linfo.org/bit.html">bits</a>)
 encoding system (i.e., uses one byte to represent each character), and 
the use of the first seven bits allows it to represent a maximum of 128 
characters. ASCII is based on the characters used to write the English 
language (including both upper and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/lower_case.html">lower case</a>
 letters). Extended versions (which utilize the eighth bit to provide a 
maximum of 256 characters) have been developed for use with other 
character sets.
</p>

<p>
Although ASCII is one of the most successful software standards ever 
developed, its limitations have become increasingly apparent as a result
 of the growing internationalization and localization of software. It is
 suitable for use only with languages that have very small character 
sets, and is not well suited for computer systems which simultaneously 
use multiple character sets.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, <i>Unicode</i> was developed as a means of allowing 
computers to deal with the full range of characters used by human 
languages. It has a goal of providing a unique encoding for every 
character that currently exists or that has ever existed (but not for 
their variant glyphs). This is accomplished by representing each 
character with two or more bytes, thus vastly increasing the total 
number of possible unique character encodings. Unicode version 2.0 
(released in 1996) listed 38,885 characters, version 3.0 (released in 
2000) listed 49,194 and version 4.0 (released in 2003) lists 96,382. 
Although Unicode has achieved considerable success, it remains a work in
 process. 
</p>

<p>
A number of issues with regard to the use of characters and writing 
systems by computers have yet to be completely resolved. They include 
(1) controversies in the case of some Chinese characters regarding what 
is the underlying character and what is the variant glyph, (2) efficient
 keyboard input systems for languages that use large numbers of 
characters, (3) software that will allow easy input and display of 
characters that are arranged other than horizontally from left to right 
(e.g., right to left or vertically), (4) political and nationalistic 
controversies about characters, (5) characters that can have multiple 
forms according to where they are used in words and (6) languages that 
use multiple character sets.
