<table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="10%"></td><td width="80%">

<br>

<p>
The <i>alias</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html"><i>command</i></a> makes it possible to launch any command or group of commands (inclusive of any options, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html">arguments</a> and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/redirection.html">redirection</a>) by entering a pre-set <a href="http://www.linfo.org/string.html"><i>string</i></a> (i.e., sequence of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">characters</a>). 
</p>

<p>
That is, it allows a user to create simple names or abbreviations (even 
consisting of just a single character) for commands regardless of how 
complex the original commands are and then use them in the same way that
 ordinary commands are used.
</p>

<p>
A command is an instruction given by a user to tell a computer to do 
something. Commands are generally issued by typing them in at the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line.html"><i>command line</i></a> (i.e., an all-text user interface) and then pressing the ENTER key, which passes them to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/shell.html"><i>shell</i></a>. A shell is a program that provides the traditional, text-only  user interface for a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating systems</a>. Its primary function is to read commands and then <i>execute</i> (i.e., run) them. 
</p>

<p>
The alias command is built into a number of shells including <i>ash</i>, <i>bash</i> (the default shell on most <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> systems), <i>csh</i> and <i>ksh</i>. It is one of several ways to customize the shell (another is setting <i>environmental variables</i>).
 Aliases are recognized only by the shell in which they are created, and
 they apply only for the user that creates them, unless that user is the
 <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root.html"><i>root</i></a> (i.e., administrative) user, which can create aliases for any user.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Listing and Creating Aliases</strong>
</p>

<p>
The general syntax for the alias command varies somewhat according to the shell. In the case of the bash shell it is
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias [-p] [name="value"]
</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When used with no arguments and with or without the <i>-p</i> option, alias provides a list of aliases that are in effect for the current user, i.e., 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some of the aliases listed are likely to be system-wide aliases that 
apply to all users and are created automatically for each new user for a
 particular shell. Aliases for any other shell can be seen by first 
switching to that shell and then using the alias command as above.
</p>

<p>
<i>name</i> is the name of the new alias and <i>value</i> is the command(s) which it initiates. The alias name and the replacement text can contain any valid shell input except for the <i>equals</i> sign ( = ). 
</p>

<p>
The commands, including any options, arguments and redirection 
operators, are all enclosed within a single pair of quotation marks, 
which can be single quotes or double quotes. No spaces are permitted 
before or after the equals sign. Any number of aliases can be created 
simultaneously by enclosing the name in each name-value pair in quotes. 
</p>

<p>
As a trivial example of alias creation, the alias <i>p</i> could be created for the commonly used <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pwd.html"><i>pwd</i></a> command, which shows the current location of the user in the directory structure (and which is an abbreviation for <i>present working directory</i>), by typing the following command and then pressing the ENTER key:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias p="pwd"</code>
</p>
</blockquote><p></p>

<p>

</p><p>
Then, to show the current location, instead of typing <i>pwd</i>, the user would only have to type the letter <i>p</i> and press the ENTER key, i.e.,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>p</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
An alias can be created with the same name as the core name of a command
 (i.e., a command without any options or arguments). In such case, it is
 the alias that is called (i.e., activated) first when the name is used,
 rather than the command with the same name. For example, an alias named
 <i>ls</i> could be created for the command <i>ls -al</i> as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias ls="ls -al"</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
ls is a commonly used command that by default lists the names of the files and directories within the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html"><i>current directory</i></a> (i.e., the directory in which the user is currently working). The <i>-a</i> option instructs <i>ls</i> to also show any <a href="http://www.linfo.org/hidden_file.html">hidden files</a> and directories, and the <i>-l</i> option tells it to provide detailed information about each file and subdirectory. </p>

<p>
Such an alias can be disabled temporarily and the core command called by
 preceding it directly (i.e., with no spaces in between) with a 
backslash, i.e., 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>\ls</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It makes no difference whether double or single quotes are used when 
creating an alias. It can be slightly easier to use single quotes 
because this obviates the need to simultaneously use the shift key. 
Thus, the above example could have been written as
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias ls='ls -al'</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This example could be simplified even further, again with no adverse 
effect on performance, by using a single character instead of two 
characters for the alias name, for example:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias l='ls -al'</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In addition to options, arguments can also be included in alias values. For example, to have the <i>ls</i> alias always display the contents of the <i>/etc</i> directory, it could be rewritten as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias l='ls -al /etc'</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Multiple commands can be included in the same alias by inserting them 
within the same pair of quotation marks and separating them with 
semicolons. For example, the alias  <i>pl</i> could be created to first launch pwd and then immediately launch ls: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias pl='pwd; ls'</code>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Aliases can even be created to call other aliases. For example, if the 
alias ls as shown earlier had already been created, then pl will launch 
it in the above example, otherwise it will launch the conventional ls 
command. If the aliases p and l shown in earlier examples have already 
been created, then the above example could alternatively be written as
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias pl='p; l'</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following is an example of creating two separate aliases 
simultaneously, as contrasted with creating a single alias that launches
 two separate commands:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias p="pwd"; l="ls -al"</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As an example of an alias for a series of commands linked by a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pipe.html"><i>pipe</i></a> (represented by a vertical line), the alias <i>dir</i> can be created to generate a list of the names of and information about all of the subdirectories in the current directory:
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias dir="ls -al | grep ^d"</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here ls -al obtains a listing of all files and directories in the current directory. Its output is sent by the pipe to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filter.html">filter</a> <i>grep</i>, which then searches for lines beginning with the letter <i>d</i> (as all directories have a line returned by ls -al that begins with d). The <i>caret</i> (i.e., upward-pointing angular character) before d tells grep to search only for lines <i>beginning</i> with that letter.
</p>

<p>
Not only can options and arguments be used in the command(s) that an 
alias can substitute for, but they can also be used with an alias that 
has already been created. As a trivial example, supposing the alias l is
 created for the ls command:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias l="ls -a"</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then, the alias l could be used with any argument that the command ls 
could be used with. For example, to list the files and directories in 
the the /etc directory:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>l /etc</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The alias l could also be used with any option that the command ls could be used with. For example:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>l -l /etc</code>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
The alias command is unusual in that it only has a single option. That option, <i>-p</i>,
 tells it to display a list of the aliases for the current user on the 
current shell. This might be helpful if used when creating an alias, but
 it is, of course, redundant when the alias command is used without 
arguments.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Uses For Aliases</strong>
</p>

<p>
There are several types of uses for aliases. They include:
</p>

<p>
(1) Reducing the amount of typing that is necessary for commands or 
groups of commands that are long and/or tedious to type. These commands 
could include opening a file that is frequently used for studying or 
editing.
</p>


<p>
For example, if a user often accesses the Apache web <a href="http://www.linfo.org/server.html">server</a> configuration file, which is <i>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</i> on Red Hat Linux 9, and uses the <i>gedit</i> text editor to read it, such user might type each time: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>gedit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, this could quickly become tedious. It would be much easier to 
make this command into an alias and give it a short name, perhaps even a
 single letter, such as <i>a</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias a="gedit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf"</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then, whenever the user wants to open the Apache configuration file 
using gedit, all that is necessary is to type the following 
single-letter command and press the ENTER key:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>a</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the location of the Apache configuration file might be 
different on different systems. Also, ordinary users will likely only be
 able to open it for reading, and only the root user will be able to 
edit it (unless the permission settings are changed).
</p>

<p>
(2) A second type of use for aliases is specifying the default version 
of a program that exists in several versions on a system or specifying 
default options for a command. For example, the following alias would 
have the ls command always list all items in a directory rather than 
just the non-hidden ones:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias ls="ls -a"</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another example of setting a more convenient default option for a command is <i>df</i>,
 which is used to show information about each partition on the system, 
including name, size, amount of space used, amount of space available 
and <i>mountpoint</i> (i.e., where it is attached to the system). The default version of df shows this data in terms of one kilo<a href="http://www.linfo.org/byte.html">byte</a> blocks (a holdover from the days when 1K was considered a lot of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/storage.html">storage</a>), but the <i>-h</i> (i.e., <i>human readable</i>)
 option makes the data easier to read by expressing it in terms of MB 
(megabytes) and GB (gigabytes). -h can be set as the default option with
 the following command:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias df="df -h"</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(3) A third use of aliases is correcting common misspellings of 
commands. For example, if a user has a habit of accidentally typing <i>pdw</i> instead of <i>pwd</i>, the following command will create an alias so that either spelling will work:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias pdw="pwd"</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(4) A fourth use of aliases is increasing the safety of the system by 
making commands interactive. This forces the user to confirm that it is 
desired to perform a specific action and thereby reduces the risk from 
accidental or impulsive abuse of powerful commands. For example, the <i>rm</i> command, which can remove files and directories and make them virtually unrecoverable, can be made interactive as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias rm="rm -i"</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, the risks associated with the <i>cp</i> command, which is used
 to copy the contents of one file to another file, can also be reduced 
by making it interactive by default. If the name for the file to be 
written to does not exist in the specified directory (by default the 
current directory), it will be created, but if it already exists, its 
contents will be overwritten. Thus, creating the following alias will 
reduce the chances of an unintended overwriting:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias cp="cp -i"
</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(5) Another use of aliases is standardizing the name of a command across
 multiple operating systems. For example, different versions of Linux or
 other operating systems contain different versions of the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/vi/index.html"><i>vi</i> text editor</a>  (i.e., vi or its <a href="http://www.linfo.org/clone.html">clones</a> <i>vim</i>, <i>nvi</i>, <i>elvis</i>, etc.), but issuing the <i>vi</i>
 command on any of these divergent systems will generally launch the 
particular vi clone that is resident on that system (assuming that the 
appropriate alias has been created). For instance, Red Hat Linux 
installs vim by default, but issuing the command vi launches vim because
 the alias <i>alias vi="vim"</i> is also installed by default for all users for the bash, csh and tcsh shells. Of course, the command <i>vim</i> can also be used, but <i>vi</i> is easier for most people to remember.
</p>

<p>
For people accustomed to <a href="http://www.linfo.org/ms-dos.html">MS-DOS</a> commands, the following aliases can be defined so that a Unix-like operating system appears to behave more like MS-DOS:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>alias dir="ls"</code>
<br>
<code>alias copy="cp"</code>
<br>
<code>alias rename="mv"</code>
<br>
<code>alias md="mkdir"</code>
<br>
<code>alias rd="rmdir"</code>
<br>
<code>alias  del="rm -i"</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, some experienced users of Unix-like systems contend that this 
may not be a good idea and that it might just make Linux seem more 
confusing, rather than simpler. Instead, they advocate having Linux 
users become accustomed to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix_upper.html">UNIX</a> terminology right from the start.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Making Aliases Permanent</strong>
</p>

<p>
The main disadvantage with the alias command is that any alias set up with it remains in effect only during the current <a href="http://www.linfo.org/login_def.html">login</a>
 session (i.e., until the user logs out or the computer is shut down). 
Although this might not be much of a problem for systems which are <i>rebooted</i>
 (i.e., restarted) only infrequently (such as corporate database 
servers), it can be a nuisance for systems that are frequently rebooted 
(e.g., home computers).
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, however, any alias can be made more enduring (i.e., until 
it is explicitly removed) by writing it to the appropriate configuration
 file with a text editor. The name and location of such file can vary 
according to the system. In the case of Red Hat Linux, an alias for any 
user can be added to the <i>.bashrc</i> file in that user's <a href="http://www.linfo.org/home_directory.html">home directory</a>. Because this file is read at login, the change will not take effect until the user has logged in again. 
</p>

<p>
Aliases for the root user can be made permanent by entering them in the .bashrc file in the root's home directory, i.e., in <i>/root/.bashrc</i>. System-wide aliases can be put in the <i>/etc/bashrc</i> file. The system needs to be restarted before system-wide aliases can take effect.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Removing Aliases</strong>
</p>

<p>
The command <i>unalias</i>, which is likewise built into bash and some 
other shells, is used to remove  entries from the current user's list of
 aliases. Its syntax is 
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
<code>unalias [-a] name(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For example, the following would remove the alias <i>rm</i> which was created in an earlier example:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>unalias rm</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>unalias</i> removes not only aliases created during the current session but also <i>permanent</i> aliases that are listed in system configuration files. The <i>-a</i> option tells unalias to remove all aliases for the current user for the current shell. 
</p>

<p>
A second way to remove an alias is by using the alias command to create a
 new alias with the same name. This overwrites the existing alias with 
that name.
</p>

<p>
A third way is to delete the alias from the appropriate configuration 
file using a text editor. For example, in the case of Red Hat, deleting 
an alias in the bash shell for a user named joe would involve removing 
the appropriate line in the file /home/joe/.bashrc. Likewise, an alias 
can be modified by editing the appropriate line in the configuration 
file.
