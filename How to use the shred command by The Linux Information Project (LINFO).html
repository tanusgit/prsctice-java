<p> 
Although it has some important limitations, the <i>shred</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> can be useful for destroying <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filedef.html">files</a>
 so that their contents are very difficult or impossible to recover. 
shred accomplishes its destruction by repeatedly overwriting files with 
data patterns designed to do maximum damage so that it becomes difficult
 to recover <a href="http://www.linfo.org/data.html">data</a> even using high-sensitivity data recovery equipment<font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font>.
</p>

<p>
Deleting a file with the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/rm.html"><i>rm</i></a>
 command does not actually destroy the data; it merely destroys an index
 listing the location of the file and makes the file's data blocks 
available for reuse. Thus, a file deleted with rm can be easily 
recovered using special utilities or commands if its freed data blocks 
have not yet been reused. However, on an active system with a nearly 
full <a href="http://www.linfo.org/hdd.html">hard disk drive</a> (HDD), freed space can be reused in a matter of minutes or even seconds. 
</p>

<p>
shred's syntax is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>shred [option(s)] file(s)_or_devices(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When used without any <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a>, shred will overwrite any designated files or <i>devices</i> 25 times, which is generally sufficient to remove all traces of the data on those files or devices. A device can be a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/partition.html">partition</a>
 (i.e., logically independent section of a HDD) or even an entire HDD, 
USB key drive, etc. Thus, for example, the following command could be 
used securely destroy the three files named <i>file1</i>, <i>file2</i> and <i>file3</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>shred file1 file2 file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This default number of overwritings can be changed by using the <i>-n</i>
 option followed by an integer representing the desired number. This is 
useful in the case of very large and/or numerous files, large 
partitions, etc., as the time required for destruction can be 
significantly reduced, but at the expense of the thoroughness of 
destruction, by reducing the number of overwritings. 
</p>

<p>
The effectiveness of shred relies on the very important assumption that the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filesystem.html">filesystem</a>
 overwrites data in place. However, many modern filesystems do not 
satisfy this assumption, including journaled filesystems (such as Ext3 
and ReiserFS), RAID-based filesystems, compressed filesystems, and 
filesystems that cache data in temporary locations<font size="-1"><sup>2</sup></font>.
 It should also be kept in mind that copies of files can be retained in 
filesystem backups and on remote mirrors. This is just another reason 
that careful consideration should be given in advance to the most 
appropriate filesystems as well as backup and mirroring policies in 
situations in which highly sensitive data is likely to be used.
</p>

<p>
Thus, it is almost always more reliable to shred an entire partition 
rather than just a file. For example, the following would destroy data 
on the seventh partition on the first HDD:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>shred /dev/hda7</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, even shredding entire partitions is not always completely reliable. One reason is that most HDDs map out bad <a href="http://www.linfo.org/sector.html">sectors</a> (i.e., sections on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/track.html">tracks</a>) invisibly to <a href="http://www.linfo.org/appslist.html">application programs</a>,
 including shred and other utilities. Thus, if sensitive data is 
contained in those sectors, shred will not be able to destroy it.   
</p>

<p>
By default, shred does not delete files or partitions after overwriting 
them. However, overwritten files can be deleted by using the <i>-u</i> option. This both frees up the disk space for other data and makes it even more difficult to reconstruct the <i>shredded</i> data (i.e., by allowing further overwriting of it). 
</p>

<p>
Among shred's other options is <i>-f</i>, which <i>forces</i> shredding by changing <a href="http://www.linfo.org/permissions.html">permissions</a> if necessary. Also, the <i>-v</i>, or <i>--verbose</i>, option tells what is happening while shred is going about its work, and the <i>--version</i> option tells what version of shred is currently installed.
</p>



<br>

<p>
________
<br>
<font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font>Even after overwriting data, it is possible for someone to take the HDD or other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/storage.html">storage</a>
 device to a specialized data recovery laboratory and use highly 
sensitive (and expensive) equipment to search for the faint traces of 
the original data, which can be relatively easy to detect if it has been
 overwritten only one or a few times. Thus, the best way to remove data 
on a HDD irretrievably is to physically destroy the media on which it is
 stored, such as by opening the drive and rubbing the individual <a href="http://www.linfo.org/platter.html">platters</a>
 with sandpaper. However, as this can be tedious, shred provides a 
alternative that can be almost as good but which requires much less 
effort and cost.
</p>

<p>
<font size="-1"><sup>2</sup></font>If one is not certain as to how a 
filesystem operates, then it should be assumed that it does not 
overwrite data in place, and thus that shred cannot operate reliably on 
files in that filesystem.
