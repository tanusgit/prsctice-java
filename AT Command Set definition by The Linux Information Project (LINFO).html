<p>
The <i>AT command set</i>, officially known as the <i>Hayes Standard AT Command Set</i>, is the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/de_facto_standard.html">de facto standard</a> set of instructions for configuring and controlling modems. 
</p>

<p>
Pronounced <i>ay-tee</i>, this set was developed by Hayes Microcomputer 
Products, a pioneer in the modem field, and it is used in its entirety 
or in part by almost every manufacturer of modems for use with personal 
computers.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">commands</a> are short sequences of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/ascii.html">ASCII</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">characters</a>. All command <a href="http://www.linfo.org/string.html"><i>strings</i></a> (i.e., sequences of characters) must be prefaced by the letters AT, an abbreviation for <i>attention</i>, thereby accounting for the name of the set.
</p>

<p>
The commands can be divided into four categories: basic, extended, 
proprietary and register. The basic commands consist of a capital letter
 followed by an integer, such as M1 (which stands for <i>speaker on until remote carrier connected</i>).
 The extended commands are an extension of the basic command set, and 
they are preceded by an ampersand to indicate that the characters that 
follow have a different meaning from what they would have in the basic 
command set (e.g., &amp;M1 has a different meaning from M1). The <a href="http://www.linfo.org/proprietary.html">proprietary</a>
 commands typically begin with either a backslash or a percentage sign. 
The register commands begin with a capital S followed by the number of 
the <i>register</i> to be changed, an equals sign, and finally the new value that is to be assigned to it.
</p>

<p>
A register is a physical location in the small amount of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/memory.html">memory</a>
 that is used to store currently or frequently used data. It is 
typically built into microprocessors, but it could be part of a separate
 memory chip in a modem. For example, the command S5=80 instructs the 
computer to set the modem's fifth register to the value 80.
</p>

<p>
There is frequently some variation in the command set according to the 
modem manufacturer. This is particularly true for the proprietary 
commands. Thus, it is best to consult the command set for a specific 
model of modem rather than relying on any generic listing of commands. 
Places where information on command sets for specific modems might be 
found include the manual or floppy disk that came with the modem, the 
Internet and the modem itself (accessed via a computer).
</p>

<p>
One of the most familiar AT commands is the ATZ that typically appears 
at the start of the modem initialization. This string is a combination 
of AT, which initiates the commands, and Z, which resets the modem to 
its default state. 
</p>

<p>
The command ATDT represents the initialization string followed by D, 
which represents dial, and T, which represents touch tone dialing (as 
opposed to P for pulse dialing).  
</p>

<p>
Modems are configured by sending AT commands to them from the computer 
on the same serial lines that are used by the computer to send data to 
the modem.
