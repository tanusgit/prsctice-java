<br><br><center><h2>The killall Command</h2></center><br>

<table width="500" align="center"><tbody><tr><td>



<p>
The <i>killall</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is used to <i>kill</i> (i.e., terminate) all <a href="http://www.linfo.org/process.html"><i>processes</i></a> (i.e., running <a href="http://www.linfo.org/instance.html">instances</a> of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">programs</a>) associated with programs whose names are provided to it as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>arguments</i></a> (i.e., inputs). 

</p>

<p>
Thus, it can be viewed as a handy alternative to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/kill.html"><i>kill</i></a> command, which is used to terminate specific processes whose <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pid.html"><i>process ID numbers</i></a> (PIDs) are provided to it as arguments.
</p>

<p>
kill and killall are utilized mainly to efficiently and cleanly terminate programs that have <i>frozen</i> and thus cannot be closed by conventional means (i.e., by selecting a menu item, by pushing a button in a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gui.html">GUI</a>, or by issuing a command). They eliminate the need to <i>reboot</i> (i.e., restart the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/computer.html">computer</a>) in order to close the program.
</p>

<p>
The PIDs can be obtained by first using the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/ps.html"><i>ps</i></a> command, which lists the names and PIDs of processes currently on the system. Alternatively, they can be obtained by using the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pstree.html"><i>pstree</i></a> command, which shows current processes in a tree diagram.  
</p>

<p>
Although the combination of ps and kill (or pstree and kill) is commonly
 employed and is often quite effective, there are situations in which it
 is either inconvenient or will not work. For example, sometimes it is 
difficult to determine what are the processes associated with a 
non-responding program, despite all of the information that can be 
gleaned from ps and pstree. killall bypasses this problem by just 
requiring the name of the program rather than one or a series of PIDs.
</p>

<p>
killall can also be useful in the case of a rare malfunction in which 
the system keeps spawning multiple instances of a program. It can be 
difficult, if not impossible, to track down the PIDs for all of these 
instances using PS and then attempt to terminate each individually using
 kill.
</p>

<p>
killall's basic syntax is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>killall [options] program_name(s) </code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When used with no <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a>,
 killall sends a signal to terminate all instances of all program names 
that are provided as arguments. For example, if it is desired to 
abruptly terminate <i>nautilus</i> (which is the official file manager for the GNOME desktop), the following command would be issued: 

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>killall nautilus</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike the kill command, it is not necessary to first try to find the 
PID(s) for nautilus. And if there are multiple instances of nautilus 
running, all will be terminated immediately. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>-i</i> option interactively asks the user for confirmation before
 killing each process. This makes it possible to kill only selective 
instances of a program, as is done routinely with kill. 

</p>

<p>
If a user is running multiple instances of killall on the system, a 
killall process can terminate all of them except for itself. That is, a 
killall process never kills itself. 
</p>

<p>
An ordinary user is only able to terminate its own processes, and thus 
it is not necessary to be concerned about the processes of other users 
on a multi-user system. However, when used by the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root.html"><i>root</i></a> (i.e., administrative) user, killall can affect processes started by all users.
</p>

<p>
If a command name is longer than 15 <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">characters</a>,
 its full name might not be available, in which case killall by default 
will terminate every process whose name matches the first 15 characters.
 The <i>-e</i> option tells killall to require an <i>exact</i> match for long names, and thus such entries are skipped. killall returns a message for each skipped entry if the <i>-v</i> (i.e., <i>verbose</i>) option is specified along with the -e option.
</p>

<p>
The <i>-g</i> option tells killall to terminate the entire process group
 to which the specified process belongs. The kill signal is only sent 
once per group, even if multiple processes belonging to the same process
 group were found.
</p>

<p>
The <i>-l</i> option tells killall to list all known signal names. The <i>-s</i>
 option specifies the type of signal to send. If -s is not used and no 
signal is specified, the killall command sends a SIGTERM signal, which 
is the same as the default signal for the kill command. killall is 
usually effective without specifying any signal. 

</p>

<p>
The <i>-q</i> (i.e., <i>quiet) </i>option, which can be considered the 
opposite of the -v option, tells killall to provide no feedback about 
the processes that are killed. The <i>-V</i> option (not to be confused with the -v option) provides information about the installed version of killall.
</p>

<p>
The <i>-w</i> option tells killall to wait for all designated processes 
to die. killall checks once per second to see if any of the supposedly 
killed processes still exist; thus, it may wait forever if the signal 
was ignored, if it had no effect, or if the process remains in a <i>zombie</i>
 (i.e., defunct) state. This option does not detect the rare situation 
in which a process disappears and is replaced by a new process with the 
same PID.
</p>

<p>
Killing by file name only works for <a href="http://www.linfo.org/executable.html"><i>executables</i></a>
 (i.e., runnable programs) that are kept open during execution. Also, 
killall may not have the desired effect in some situations, including on
 some non-<a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> systems, in which case kill provides a viable alternative.
