<p>
The <i>bzip2</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is used for compressing and decompressing files. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.linfo.org/data_compression.html"><i>Data compression</i></a>, also referred to as just <i>compression</i>, is the process of encoding <a href="http://www.linfo.org/data.html">data</a> using fewer <a href="http://www.linfo.org/bit.html"><i>bits</i></a>. <i>Data decompression</i>, or just <i>decompression</i>, is the process of restoring compressed data back into a form in which it is again useful.
</p>

<p>
bzip2 features a high rate of compression together with reasonably fast 
speed. Most files can be compressed to a smaller file size than is 
possible with the more traditional <i>gzip</i> and <i>zip</i> programs. Moreover, like those programs, the compression is <i>lossless</i>,
 meaning that no data is lost during compression and thus the original 
files can be exactly regenerated. The only disadvantage of bzip2 is that
 it is somewhat slower than gzip and zip. 
</p>

<p>
This performance has been made possible through the use of the <i>Burrows-Wheeler transform</i> (BWT). First published by Michael Burrows and David Wheeler in 1994, BWT is not by itself a data compression <a href="http://www.linfo.org/algorithm.html">algorithm</a>; rather, it converts blocks of data into a format that is extremely well suited for compression. In addition, it is <i>reversible</i>, which means that the original data can be easily regenerated. 
</p>

<p>
bzip2's syntax is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>bzip2 [option(s)] file_name(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
bzip2 is commonly used without any <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a>. Any number of files can be compressed simultaneously by merely listing their names as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html">arguments</a> (i.e., inputs). Thus, for example, the following would compress the three files named <i>file1</i>, <i>file2</i> and <i>file3</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>bzip2 file1 file2 file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If no problems are encountered, by default no confirmation is provided. 
However, if some problem is encountered, an error message is returned 
for each file for which there is a problem. Should confirmation and data
 on the degree of compression be desired, then bzip2 can be used with 
its <i>-v</i> (i.e., <i>verbose</i>) option, such as 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>bzip2 -v file1 file2 file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Each file is replaced by a compressed version of itself, with the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filename_extension.html">extension</a> <i>.bz2</i> appended to its name. Thus, in the case of the above example, the three input files would be replaced by files named <i>file1.bz2</i>, <i>file2.bz2</i> and <i>file3.bz2</i>. This can be easily confirmed with the <i>ls</i> (i.e., <i>list</i>) command, and the sizes of the new files can be viewed by using ls together with its <i>-s</i> (i.e., <i>size</i>) option. The original files can be retained by using the <i>-k</i> (i.e., <i>keep</i>) option. 
</p>

<p>
Each compressed file retains to the extent possible the same <a href="http://www.linfo.org/metadata.html">metadata</a> (i.e., modification date, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/permissions.html">access permissions</a> and ownership) as the corresponding original file, so that this data can be correctly restored at decompression time. 
</p>

<p>
Compression is performed even if the compressed file is larger than the 
original. This situation can occur in the case of very small files, 
because the compression mechanism has a fixed overhead of about 50 <a href="http://www.linfo.org/byte.html">bytes</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>-s</i> (i.e., <i>small</i>) option reduces <a href="http://www.linfo.org/memory.html">memory</a> usage for compression, decompression and testing, which is useful for <a href="http://www.linfo.org/computer.html">computers</a>
 with very small memories (e.g., 8MB or less). Files are decompressed 
and tested using a modified algorithm that only requires 2.5 bytes per 
block, although this results in a reduction in speed by about half. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>-t</i> (i.e., <i>test</i>) option tells bzip2 to check the 
integrity of the specified file(s) by performing a trial decompression 
and discarding the result. There is no effect on the specified files.
</p>

<p>
As a safety measure, by default bzip2 will not overwrite existing files 
with the same names (inclusive of extensions) as its output files or 
break <i>hard links</i> (i.e., alternative names for a single file). However, the <i>-f</i> option <i>forces</i> the overwriting of existing files and also instructs bzip2 to break hard links to files.
</p>

<p>
The <i>-d</i> option tells bzip2 to <i>decompress</i> the specified files. It is the same as the <i>bunzip2</i>
 command. Files that were not created by bzip2 will be detected and 
ignored, and a warning will be issued. An attempt is made to guess the 
original name for each file being decompressed; however, if the 
compressed version does not end in one of the recognized extensions 
(i.e., .bz2, .bz, .tbz2 or .tbz), then bzip2 will complain that it 
cannot guess the name of the original file and will use the name of the 
compressed version with the <i>.out</i> extension appended to it.
</p>

<p>
It is often convenient to store a number of files in a compressed <a href="http://www.linfo.org/archive.html"><i>archive</i></a>,
 which is a single file that contains any number of individual files 
plus information to allow them to be restored to their original form by 
one or more extraction programs. This can be accomplished by first 
combining the uncompressed files using the <i>tar</i> command together with its <i>-c</i> and <i>-f</i>
 options and then using bzip2 on the combined file. The -c option 
instructs tar to combine the files, and the -f option tells it to use 
the argument that follows as the name of the new file. For example, the 
following commands would combine three files named <i>file4</i>, <i>file5</i> and <i>file6</i> into a single archive named <i>file7.tar</i> and then compress that archive into a compressed file named <i>file7.tar.bz2</i>:

</p><blockquote>
<p>
<code>tar -cf file7.tar file4 file5 file6</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>bzip2 file7.tar</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alternatively, this can all be accomplished in a single step by merely adding the <i>-j</i>
 option to tar, which tells tar to compress the archive that it creates 
with bzip2. Thus, the above example would be simplified to:

</p><blockquote>
<p>
<code>tar -cjf file7.tar.bz2 file4 file5 file6</code>
</p>
