<br><br><center><h2>The head Command</h2></center><br>

<table width="520" align="center"><tbody><tr><td>



<p>
The <i>head</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> reads the first few lines of any text given to it as an input and writes them to <a href="http://www.linfo.org/standard_output.html"><i>standard output</i></a> (which, by default, is the display screen).
</p>

<p>
head's basic syntax is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>head [options] [file(s)]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The square brackets indicate that the enclosed items are optional. By default, head returns the first ten lines of each <a href="http://www.linfo.org/file.html">file</a> name that is provided to it. 
</p>

<p>
For example, the following will display the first ten lines of the file named <i>aardvark</i> in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html">current directory</a> (i.e., the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/directory.html">directory</a> in which the user is currently working):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>head aardvark</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If more than one input file is provided, head will return the first ten 
lines from each file, precede each set of lines by the name of the file 
and separate each set of lines by one vertical space. The following is 
an example of using head with two input files: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>head aardvark armadillo</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If it is desired to obtain some number of lines other than the default ten, the <i>-n</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">option</a>
 can be used followed by an integer indicating the number of lines 
desired. For example, the above example could be modified to display the
 first 15 lines from each file:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>head -n15 aardvark armadillo</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
-n is a very tolerant option. For example, it is not necessary for the 
integer to directly follow it without a space in between. Thus, the 
following command would produce the same result:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>head -n &nbsp; 15 aardvark armadillo</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In fact, the letter <i>n</i> does not even need to be used at all. Just 
the hyphen and the integer (with no intervening space) are sufficient to
 tell head how many lines to return. Thus, the following would produce 
the same result as the above commands:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>head -15 aardvark armadillo</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
head can also return any desired number of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/byte.html">bytes</a> (i.e., a sequence of eight <a href="http://www.linfo.org/bit.html">bits</a> and usually long enough to represent a single <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">character</a>) from the start of each file rather than a desired number of lines. This is accomplished using the <i>-c</i>
 option followed by the number of bytes desired. For example, the 
following would display the first five bytes of each of the two files 
provided: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>head -c 5 aardvark anteater</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When head counts by bytes, it also includes the <i>newline character</i>, which is a <i>non-printing</i> (i.e, invisible) character that is designated by a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/backslash.html">backslash</a> and the letter <i>n</i> (i.e., <i>\n</i>).
 Thus, for example, if there are three new, blank lines at the start of a
 file, they will be counted as three characters, along with the <i>printing characters</i> (i.e., characters that are visible on the monitor screen or on paper).
</p>

<p>
The number of bytes or lines can be followed by a multiplier suffix. That is, adding the letter <i>b</i> directly after the number of bytes multiplies it by 512, <i>k</i> multiplies it by 1024 and <i>m</i> multiplies it by 1048576. Thus, the following command would display the first five kilobytes of the file aardvark:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>head -c5k aardvark</code>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
The -c option is less tolerant than the -n option. That is, there is no 
default number of bytes, and thus some integer must be supplied. Also, 
the letter <i>c</i> cannot be omitted as can the letter <i>n</i>, 
because in such case head would interpret the hyphen and integer 
combination as the -n option. Thus, for example, the following would 
produce an error message something like <i>head: aardvark: invalid number of bytes</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>head -c aardvark</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If head is used without any options or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>arguments</i></a>
 (i.e., file names), it will await input from the keyboard and will 
successively repeat (i.e., each line will appear twice) on the monitor 
screen each of the first ten lines typed on the keyboard. If it were 
desired to repeat some number of lines other than the default ten, then 
the -n option would be used followed by the integer representing that 
number of lines (although, again, it is not necessary to include the 
letter <i>n</i>), e.g.,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>head -n3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As is the case with other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line.html">command line</a> (i.e., all-text mode) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">programs</a> in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> and other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_system.html">operating systems</a>, the output from head can <a href="http://www.linfo.org/redirection.html"><i>redirected</i></a> from the display monitor to a file or printer using the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/output_redirection_%20operator.html"><i>output redirection operator</i></a>
 (which is represented by a rightward-pointing angular bracket). For 
example, the following would copy the first 12 lines of the file <i>Yuriko</i> to the file <i>December</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>head -n 12 Yuriko &gt; December</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the file named December did not yet exist, the redirection operator 
would create it; if it already existed, the redirection operator would 
overwrite it. To avoid erasing data on an existing file, the <i>append operator</i>
 (which is represented by two consecutive rightward pointing angle 
brackets) could be used to add the output from head to the end of a file
 with that name if it already existed (or otherwise create a new file 
with that name), i.e.,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>head -n 12 Yuriko &gt;&gt; December</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The output from other commands can be sent via a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pipes.html"><i>pipe</i></a> (represented by the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/vertical_bar_character.html">vertical bar character</a>) to head to use as its input. For example, the following sends the output from the <i>ls</i>
 command (which by default lists the names of the files and directories 
in the current directory) to head, which, in turn, displays the first 
ten lines of the output that it receives from ls:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls | head</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This output could easily be redirected, for example to the end of a file named <i>file1</i> as follows: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls | head &gt;&gt; file1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It could also be piped to one or more <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filter.html">filters</a> for additional processing. For example, the <i>sort</i> filter could be used with its <i>-r</i> option to sort the output in reverse <a href="http://www.linfo.org/alphabet.html">alphabet</a>ic order prior to appending file1: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls | head | sort -r &gt;&gt; file1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>-q</i> (i.e., <i>quiet</i>) option causes head to not show the 
file name before each set of lines in its output and to eliminate the 
vertical space between each set of lines when there are multiple input 
sources. Its opposite, the <i>-v</i> (i.e., <i>verbose</i>) option, causes head to provide the file name even if there is just a single input file. 
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.linfo.org/tail.html"><i>tail</i></a> command is similar to the head command except that it reads the final lines in files rather than the first lines.
</p>

<p>
As is the case with other commands on Unix-like operating systems, 
additional information can be obtained about head and tail by using the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/man.html"><i>man</i></a> and <i>info</i> commands to reference the built-in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/documentation.html">documentation</a>, for example
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>man head</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
or
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>info tail</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
