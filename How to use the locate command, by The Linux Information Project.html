<p>
The <i>locate</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is often the simplest and quickest way to find the locations of files and directories on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> and other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating systems</a>.
</p>

<p>
The basic syntax for locate is: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>locate [options] name(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When used without any <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a>, locate displays every <a href="http://www.linfo.org/absolute_pathname.html"><i>absolute pathname</i></a> for which the user has access permission that contains any of the names of files and/or directories that are provided to it as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html">arguments</a> (i.e., input data).
</p>

<p>
The absolute pathname, also referred to as the <i>absolute path</i> or the <i>full path</i>, is the hierarchy of directories from the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root_directory.html"><i>root directory</i></a> to the designated file or directory. The root directory is the directory at the very top of the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filesystem.html">filesystem</a>
 (i.e., hierarchy of files) that contains all other directories and 
files on the system and which is designated by a forward slash ( / ). It
 is important that the absolute pathname is returned both because it 
tells the exact locations on the system and because it makes it possible
 to indicate the locations of files or directories that have the same 
name but different absolute paths.
</p>

<p>
Thus, for example, the following would list the absolute paths of all files named <i>file1</i> and all directories named <i>dir1</i> for which the user had access permission: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>locate file1 dir1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It would also list any other absolute pathnames that contained these <a href="http://www.linfo.org/string.html">strings</a> (i.e., sequences of characters), for example <i>/home/john/file123</i> or <i>/usr/local/mydir1/index.html</i>.
</p>

<p>
The specificity of locate can be increased by using it together with <i>wildcards</i> or other <i>regular expressions</i>. Wildcards are <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">characters</a>
 that can be used to substitute for any other character or characters. 
For example, the star character ( * ) is a wildcard that can represent 
any single character or any string containing any number of characters. 
Regular expressions are a string that describes or matches a set of 
strings, according to certain syntax rules. For example, the following 
command uses the star wildcard to display all files on the system that 
have the <i>.png</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filename_extension.html">filename extension</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>locate "*.png"</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>-q</i> option is used to suppress error messages, such as those 
that might be returned in the event that the user does not have 
permission to access designated files or directories. Thus, the 
following would suppress any error messages in the above example: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>locate "*.png" -q</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is often the case that a large number of results will be returned for any query. The <i>-n</i>
 option followed by an integer limits the results to a specific number. 
For example, the following command would display only 15 results in a 
search for files that have an <i>.html</i> extension:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>locate  -n 15 "*.html"</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
An alternative is to use a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pipe.html"><i>pipe</i></a> (represented by the vertical bar character) to <a href="http://www.linfo.org/redirection.html">redirect</a> the output of locate from the display screen to a <i>pager</i> such as <i>more</i> or <i>less</i>, which presents only one screenful of output at a time, for example,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>locate  "*.html" | less</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <i>-i</i> option performs a case-insensitive search. That is, it 
will return any results that match the arguments regardless of whether 
individual letters are <a href="http://www.linfo.org/lower_case.html">lower case</a> or upper case. For example, the following would return all files with the extension .html, .HTML, or some combination thereof:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>locate -i "*.HtmL"</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p> 
On some systems, such as Red Hat, the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">program</a> <i>slocate</i>
 is installed by default instead of locate, and entering the locate 
command activates a script (i.e., a short program) that causes slocate 
to be launched. slocate provides a secure way to index and quickly 
search for files on a system by storing file permissions and ownership 
data so that users will not see files for which they do not have access.
 
</p>

<p>
The <i>-V</i> option can be used to show which version of locate is 
used, including whether it is locate or slocate. Another way to 
determine whether slocate is being used is to see if an absolute 
pathname such as <i>/usr/bin/slocate</i> is returned when the following command is issued: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>locate locate</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
locate and slocate actually search a built-in database, named <i>locate.db</i> or <i>slocate.db</i>,
 respectively, rather than the entire hard disk drive itself, in order 
to provide a much shorter searching time. This database is automatically
 updated on a regular basis by <i>cron</i>, a small program that runs in
 the background, performing various tasks at regularly scheduled 
intervals. The updating is performed each night if the computer is on 
continuously.
</p>

<p>
Because the database is not updated immediately, recently created files 
and directories might not show up when searching for them with locate or
 slocate. Fortunately, however, it is a simple matter to update the 
database manually, although it might take a few minutes. Manual updating
 can be accomplished by logging in as the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root.html">root user</a> (i.e., administrative user), such as by using the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/su.html"><i>su</i></a> (i.e., <i>substitute user</i>) command, and then issuing the following command:  
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>updatedb</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The same thing can be accomplished by the root user by using locate with its <i>-u</i> (i.e., <i>update</i>) option, i.e., 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>locate -u</code>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
For the curious, the database is located at <i>/var/lib/slocate/slocate.db</i>
 on some systems, such as Red Hat. Its exact location on any particular 
system can be found by the root user (because ordinary users will not 
have access permission on most systems) with the locate command as 
follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>locate locate.db</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The database is a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/binary_file.html">binary file</a>
 (i.e., a non-text file). However, for the really curious user who has 
root permission, the human-readable portion of its contents can be 
viewed by first using the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/strings.html">strings</a> command to extract all the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/plain_text.html">plain text</a> and by then piping the output to less for displaying one screenful at a time as follows: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>strings /var/lib/slocate/slocate.db  | less</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If it is desired to perform a more sophisticated search, including 
searching by attributes other than name (e.g., by size, creation date or
 location), the <i>find</i> command should be used.
