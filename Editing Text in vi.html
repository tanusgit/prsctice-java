<p>vi offers a rich assortment of commands for editing text. Among the most basic are those used for deleting or erasing. </p>

<p>The <b>x</b>  (lower case "x") command deletes the character 
immediately under (i,e., covered by) the cursor. To delete any desired 
character, just switch to the command mode (if you are not already 
there) and then use an appropriate combination of the <b>h</b>, <b>j</b>, <b>k</b> and <b>l</b> commands (of course, one at a time) to move the cursor to that character. Then type <code>x</code>
and the character is deleted.
</p>


<p>By pressing <code>x</code> continuously instead of just hitting it 
once, the cursor continuously moves to the right and each character 
under it is successively deleted.</p>

<p>The <b>X</b> (upper case "X") command is similar except that it 
deletes the character to the left of the cursor rather than the 
character under it.

</p><p>There are several additional commands for deleting text. The
 <b>D</b> (upper case "D") command removes the text on the current line from the character under the cursor to the end of the line. 

</p>


<p>
The  <b>d</b> (lower case "d") command is  very flexible because it can 
be modified to delete any number of characters, words or lines. Typing 
<code>d</code> by itself will not do anything, but typing <code>dw</code>
 causes the character the cursor is resting on and the remaining 
characters to the right of it in the same word to be deleted. (The "w" 
stands for "word.") </p>


<p>
Typing <code>2dw</code> causes the character under the cursor, the 
remaining characters to the right of it in the same word and all of the 
characters in the next word to be deleted. For example, typing <code>2dw</code> with the cursor on the "a" of the string "pineapple plantation" causes the string "apple plantation" to be deleted. 
</p>


<p>
As another example, typing <code>3dw</code> with the cursor on the "j" 
of the string "the bluejay flew south" causes the string "jay flew 
south" to be deleted. That is,  "jay" and two words to the right of it 
are deleted. 
</p>


<p>

Deleting an entire line can be accomplished with the  <b>dd</b> command.
 This command can also be used to delete multiple lines by preceding it 
with an integer representing the number of lines to be removed. For 
example, typing <code>2dd</code> will delete two consecutive lines beginning with the current line. 
</p>

<p>

With some terminals, deletion of a line causes it to be replaced on the 
screen with  an "@" character.
This character merely represents an empty line and is not inserted into 
the text. Its purpose is to relieve the processor from having to redraw 
the screen (i.e., change the whole screen). This character can be 
removed if desired by 
typing <code>r</code> (or <code>l</code> on some terminals) while holding down the CTRL key.

</p>


<p>
The change command <b>c</b> (lower case "c")  differs from the delete 
command in that it not only deletes a section of text but also activates
 insert mode to allow you to type in replacement text. After you have 
completed typing in the replacement  text, be sure to press ESC to 
return to the command mode.
</p>

<p>
As is the case with <b>d</b>, the <b>c</b> command is not used by itself but is only used in combination with another letter after it and an optional integer before it. 
</p>

<p> For example, the command <b>cw</b> (which stands for "change word") 
deletes the characters in the current word under and to the right of the
 cursor and then switches vi to the insert mode so that you can enter 
text to replace the deleted characters. The number of new characters 
typed in can be the same as, fewer or more than the number deleted.
</p>

<p>
The amount of text to be changed can be increased by preceding the command with a number. For instance, typing <code>2cw</code>
 will additionally remove the next word for replacement with whatever is
 typed in. The space between the words is not preserved. 
</p>


<p>
The <b>d</b> and <b>c</b> commands can also be modified by  other 
characters in addition to "w." For example they can be used with "b," 
which stands for "back." Thus, typing <code>3bd</code> will delete the 
characters to the left of the cursor in the current word together with 
the two words to the left of the current word.                
</p>

<p>
The <b>cc</b> command erases the current line, leaving it blank and 
awaiting replacement text. Preceding this command with an integer will 
delete that number of lines, beginning with the current line. For 
example, typing <b>5cc</b> will allow you to change five consecutive lines starting with the current line. </p>

<p>
Another change command, <b>R</b>, differs from the <b>c</b> commands in that it does not initially delete anything. Rather, it
activates insert mode and lets you replace the characters under the cursor one at a time with characters that you type in. 
</p>


<p>
vi supports several types of transposition. 
Transposing the order of two adjacent characters is easy with the  <b>xp</b> command. Just place the cursor on the left-most of the two characters, type <code>x</code> to erase the left character and then type <code>p</code> for the deleted character to be put to the right of the cursor. 
</p>

<p>
Two adjacent words can be transposed with the <b>deep</b> command. To use it, position the cursor in the space just to the left of the word on the left and type <code>deep</code>.      Two adjacent lines can be transposed with the <b>ddp</b> command by placing the cursor on the upper line and typing <code>ddp</code>.

</p>

<p>It is also a simple matter to change the case of a letter. When the 
cursor is over the desired letter, hit the "~" (tilde) key. This will 
change a capital letter to a small letter and visa versa.
</p>


<p>
The <b>J</b> (upper case "J") command is used to join the next line to 
the current line. The opposite operation, splitting a line, is 
accomplished in insert mode by merely positioning the cursor over what 
will be the first character of the new line and then hitting ENTER.
</p>

<p>
vi also has an undo capability. The  <b>u</b> (lower case "u") command 
is used to reverse the effects  of an already issued command that has 
changed the buffer, but which is not yet written to disk. <b>U</b> (upper case "U") undoes all of the changes that have been made to the current line during your current visit to it.
