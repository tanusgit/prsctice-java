<p>Many Linux users avoid using vi because of their bewildering and 
frustrating initial experience with it. vi is definitely not intuitive 
-- at least for neophytes.  Particularly confusing to new users is their
  inability to simply begin typing away when vi starts, in contrast to  
conventional text editors and word processors. 
</p>

<p>
However, vi gradually becomes easier to use after practice. In fact, its
 adherents claim that it is extremely fast and efficient once you become
 accustomed to it, and many people come to miss its power in situations 
where they have to use other text editors. </p>


<p>
Although vi's role as the standard Linux and Unix editor may be to some 
extent an accident of history, this editor also has features which 
definitely merit its continued popularity and widespread use: 
</p>

<ul>
<li> It is present in almost every Linux Unix system, even the most minimal. 
<p></p>

</li><li><p> It is very small. In fact, some versions have a total code 
size of less than 100KB. This makes it easy to include vi on even the 
tiniest versions of Linux, such as those in embedded systems and those 
that run from a single floppy disk.</p>

</li><li><p> It is typist-friendly, at least once you get used to it. 
For example, the commands are very short, usually just a few keystrokes.
 And because vi does not use the mouse, there is never any need to 
remove one's hands from the keyboard. This can speed up editing 
substantially.</p> 

</li><li><p> It is very powerful, as just a few very short commands can 
make sweeping changes to large documents.  In fact, vi is more powerful 
than most of its users realize, and few of them know more than just  
fraction of all the commands. 

</p></li></ul>



<p>
Even if you are not going to use it as your main editor, becoming 
familiar with vi can still be a good investment.  For example, many Unix
 tools, applications and games employ a subset of vi's commands. This 
includes some of the best diagnostic and forensic tools, even those for 
use with other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows. Moreover, vi
 is often the only editor still available for use while trying to repair
 a damaged Linux or Unix system that retains only minimal functionality.
   </p>


<p>
vi has a total of approximately 150 basic commands. However, it is only 
necessary to know about a dozen of them in order to be able to use it 
effectively. And you can become really fast after you have learned about
 two dozen. This tutorial covers enough commands to make you a fairly 
accomplished vi user and set you on your way to becoming a true 
Linux/Unix geek.</p>
