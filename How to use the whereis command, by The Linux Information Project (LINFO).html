<p>
The <i>whereis</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is used to locate the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/binary.html"><i>binary</i></a>, the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/source_code.html"><i>source code</i></a> and the <i>online manual page</i> for any specified <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">program</a>.
</p>

<p>
A binary is an <a href="http://www.linfo.org/executable.html"><i>executable</i></a>
 (i.e., ready to run) form of a program. Source code is the original 
form of a program as written by a human using a programming language and
 before it has been converted by a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/compiler.html">compiler</a> into a binary. The online manual pages, commonly referred to as <i>man pages</i>, are normally accessed using the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/man.html"><i>man</i></a> command.
</p>

<p>
whereis's basic syntax is
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>whereis [option(s)] program_name(s) </code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When used without any <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a>, which is most commonly the case, whereis attempts to supply the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/absolute_pathname.html"><i>absolute path names</i></a> (i.e., the path to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root_directory.html">root directory</a>)
 for the binary, source code and man page for every program name 
(including command names, which are generally the same as program names)
 that is supplied to it as an <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>argument</i></a> (i.e., input). Any number of names can be accepted as arguments, and the results for each will be returned on a separate line. 
</p>

<p>
Thus, for example, the following would be used to <i>attempt</i> to find the locations of the executable, source code and man page for the <i>ls</i> command (which is used to list the contents of any specified directory):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>whereis ls</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although whereis ideally returns three pieces of information for each 
argument, in reality it often returns fewer and sometimes returns more. 
For example, it will not return a location for source code for a program
 on a computer for which the source code has not been installed (which 
is common when programs are installed in precompiled form during 
installation of the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_system.html">operating system</a>). Likewise, there may be no man pages for some commands, or there may be more than one.
</p>

<p>
For some commands it might be the case that no executable is returned. Examples include <a href="http://www.linfo.org/alias.html"><i>alias</i></a> and <i>umask</i>. This is presumably because no separate executables with these names exist and such commands are built directly into the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/shell.html"><i>shell</i></a> (i.e., the program that executes commands typed in by a user and displays their results).
</p>

<p>
If an executable, source code or man page <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filedef.html">file</a>
 exists on a computer but has not installed in a standard location, no 
result will be returned for it. This is because whereis only searches in
 such locations. An example is the situation in which a user has 
installed a program in its <a href="http://www.linfo.org/home_directory.html"><i>home directory</i></a>
 (i.e., the directory which contains configuration files, programs and 
data specific to that user) rather than in directories that are 
accessible to all users.
</p>

<p>
In the event that nothing is found for one or more of the three types of
 information for which whereis searches for each argument, no error 
message or other notification is provided. If multiple results are 
found, whereis returns all of them.
</p>

<p>
In some situations, whereis might return only a single entry for some commands. This is true in the case of the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/spell.html"><i>spell</i></a>
 command (which, as its name implies, is used to check the spelling of 
text files), at least on some systems, as can be seen by running the 
following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>whereis spell</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>      
Several options are available to limit the type of results returned by whereis (as is the case with the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/wc.html"><i>wc</i></a> command, which by default counts the number of lines, words and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">characters</a> that are contained in text). The <i>-b</i> option tells it to search only for binaries. The <i>-m</i> option tells it to search only for man pages. The <i>-s</i>
 option tells it to search only for sources. Thus, for example, the 
following could be used to search for only the binaries and source code 
for the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/whoami.html"><i>whoami</i></a> command (which reports the owner of the current <a href="http://www.linfo.org/login_def.html">login</a> session):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>whereis -b whoami</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>      
As is generally (but not always) the case with single-letter options for
 shell programs, these options can be used together in any combination 
and any order. The order in which the results are displayed is not 
affected by the order in which the options are used.
