<p> 
The <i>reboot</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is used to restart a computer without turning the power off and then back on. 
</p>

<p>
reboot's syntax is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>reboot [option]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
reboot accepts no <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>arguments</i></a> (i.e., input data) and is commonly used without any <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a>. That is, the command is usually just issued as 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>reboot</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If reboot is used when the system is not in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/runlevel_def.html">runlevel</a> 0 or 6 (i.e., the system is operating normally), then it invokes the <i>shutdown</i> command with its <i>-r</i> (i.e., reboot) option.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps reboot's most useful option is <i>-f</i>, which is used to <i>force</i> a reboot in those rare situations in which reboot by itself might not work, for example due to a corrupted system. The <i>-i</i> option tells reboot to shut down all <a href="http://www.linfo.org/network.html">network</a> interfaces prior to rebooting. 
</p>

<p>
Pressing the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/reset_button.html"><i>reset button</i></a>
 (which is located on the exterior of many personal computers) has an 
effect similar to that of using reboot. In those rare situations in 
which the entire system <i>crashes</i> (i.e., ceases to function properly, if at all) and the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line.html">command line</a>
 (i.e., the all-text display mode) is no longer accessible or operable, 
then the only choice is to use the reset button or to turn the power off
 for a few minutes and then restart the computer.	
</p>

<p>
The reboot command takes its name directly from the term <a href="http://www.linfo.org/boot.html"><i>boot</i></a>, which means to start a computer, and ultimately from the word <i>bootstrap</i>, which was a strap attached to the top of a boot that was used by people to pull their boots on.
