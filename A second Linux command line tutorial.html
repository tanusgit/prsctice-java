The article <i><a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line_lesson_1.html">How to Use the Command Line, A First Lesson</a></i> briefly describes the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line.html">command line</a>, explains why it is important, and tells how to access it. It also introduces what are probably the three most basic <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">commands</a> on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> and other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating systems</a>: <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pwd.html"><i>pwd</i></a> (which shows the directory in which the user is presently working), <i>ls</i> (which lists the files and directories) and <i>cd</i> (which changes directories).
This lesson introduces six commonly used commands for creating, removing, copying and moving files and directories. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>The touch Command</strong>
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.linfo.org/touch.html"><i>touch</i></a> command is the easiest way to create new, empty files. Its syntax is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>touch [option] file_name(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
No <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a> are required for basic file creation. Thus, for example, to create a new file named <i>file1</i> within the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html"><i>current directory</i></a>
 (i.e., the directory in which the user is currently working), all that 
is necessary is to type the following command and then press the ENTER 
key:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>touch file1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Any number of files can be created simultaneously with touch. Each name 
must be separated by at least one space. Thus, example, the following 
would create three files named <i>file2</i>, <i>file3</i>, <i>file4</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>touch file2 file3 file4</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The existence of these new files can easily be confirmed by using the <i>ls</i>
 command and seeing if they are included in its output. For example, the
 following would provide the names of all of the files and directories 
in the current directory: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A useful feature of touch is that, in contrast to some commands, it does not automatically <i>overwrite</i> (i.e., erase the contents of) existing files that have the same names as new files being created.  
</p>

<p>
<strong>The mkdir Command</strong>
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.linfo.org/mkdir.html"><i>mkdir</i></a> command is is used to create new directories (which are also referred to as <i>folders</i> in some operating systems). Its syntax is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>mkdir [option] directory_name(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>                                                        
As is the case with touch, mkdir is usually used without any of its few options. <i>directory_name</i>
 is the name of any directory that the user is asking mkdir to create. 
Any number of directories can be created simultaneously. Thus, for 
example, the following would create three directories in the current 
directory with the names <i>dir1</i>, <i>dir2</i> and <i>dir3</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>                                                                                
If a directory name provided as an <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>argument</i></a>
 (i.e., input) to mkdir is the same as that of an existing directory or 
file in the same directory in which the user is asking mkdir to create 
the new directory, mkdir will return a warning message such as <i>mkdir: cannot create directory `dir_1': File exists</i>
 and will not create a directory with that name. However, it will then 
continue to create directories for any other names provided as 
arguments. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>The rm Command</strong>
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.linfo.org/rm.html"><i>rm</i></a> command is often the most efficient way to remove files and directories. Its syntax is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rm [option] file_name(s)</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, for example, to delete file1, the following would be used:
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rm file1</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
rm can delete any number of files simultaneously. Thus, for example, the following would remove both file2 and file3:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rm file2 file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This can become tedious if it is desired to delete a large number of 
files, such as all of the files within a directory. A much more 
efficient (but also more dangerous) way to do this is to use <i>wildcards</i>, which can be used to represent anything. For example, the star (*) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">character</a> is a wildcard that can represent any <a href="http://www.linfo.org/string.html"><i>string</i></a> (i.e., any sequence of characters). Therefore, the following would delete every file in the current directory:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rm *</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And the following would remove everything in the directory dir1:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rm dir1/*</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As another illustration of the great versatility that wildcards add to 
the command line, the following would delete all files in the current 
directory that have a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filename_extension.html">file name extension</a> of <i>.html</i> but would leave all others intact:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rm *.html</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As a safety measure, rm does not delete directories by default. This is 
important because once deleted, it is extremely difficult or impossible 
to recover deleted data on Unix-like operating systems (in contrast to 
the Microsoft Windows operating systems). In order to delete 
directories, it is necessary to use the <i>-r</i> option or the <i>-R</i> option (they are the same). This option <i>recursively</i>
 removes directories, along with all of their contents, that are 
included in the argument list; that is, the specified directories will 
first be emptied of any subdirectories (including their subdirectories 
and files, etc.) and files and then removed. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>The rmdir Command</strong>
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.linfo.org/rmdir.html"><i>rmdir</i></a> command provides another way to remove empty directories. Its syntax is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rmdir [option] directory_names</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When used without any options, rm will delete any empty directories 
whose names are supplied as arguments. Thus, for example, the following 
command would remove two empty directories named <i>dir4</i> and <i>dir5</i> that are located in the current directory: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>rmdir dir4 dir5</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The ability to remove only empty directories is a built-in safeguard 
that helps prevent the accidental loss of data. In contrast to the rm 
command, there is no <i>-r</i> option, at least on the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gnu.html">GNU</a>
 version that is standard on Linux. Thus, if a user wants to remove an 
entire directory structure, it is usually most efficient to use rm with 
its -r option rather than trying to first remove the contents of each 
directory, its subdirectories, etc. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>The cp Command</strong>
</p>

<p>
The <i>cp</i> command is used to copy files and directories. The copies 
become independent of the originals (i.e., a subsequent change in one 
will not affect the other). 
</p>

<p>
cp's basic syntax is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cp [options] name new_name</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
 If a file with the same name as that assigned to the copy of a file (or
 a directory with the same name as that assigned to the copy of a 
directory) already exists, it will be overwritten. By default, cp only 
copies files and not directories.
</p>

<p>
When a copy is made of a file or directory, the copy must have a 
different name than the original if it is to be placed in the same 
directory as the original. However, the copy can have the same name if 
it is made in a different directory. Thus, for example, a file named <i>file4</i> which resides in the current directory could be copied with the same name into another directory, such as into <i>/home/john/</i>, as follows:
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cp file4 /home/john/file4</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Any number of files can be simultaneously copied into another directory 
by listing their names followed by the name of the directory. cp is an <i>intelligent</i>
 command and knows to do this when only the final argument is a 
directory. The files copied into the directory will all have the same 
names as the originals. Thus, for example, the following would copy the 
files named <i>file5</i>, <i>file6</i> and <i>file7</i> into a directory named <i>dir6</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cp file5 file6 file7 dir6</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
cp's <i>-r</i> option, which can also be written with an upper case -R, 
allows directories including all of their contents to be copied. Thus, 
for example, the following command would make a copy of an existing 
directory called <i>dir7</i>, inclusive of all it contents (i.e., files, subdirectories, their subdirectories, etc.), called <i>dir8</i>: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cp -r dir7 dir8</code>

</p>
</blockquote>
<br>


<p>
<strong>The mv Command</strong>
</p>

<p>
The <i>mv</i> command is used to rename and move files and directories. Its basic syntax is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>mv [options] source target</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the target file or directory is located in the same directory as the 
source file or directory, then the source file or directory can only be 
renamed. If both are in different directories, then the source file or 
directory is moved to a new directory, in which it can keep its original
 name or be assigned a new name.
</p>

<p>
Thus, for example, to rename a file called <i>file8</i> to <i>file9</i>, both in the current directory, the following would be used:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>mv file8 file9</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following would move a file named <i>file10</i>, without changing its name, from the current directory to an existing subdirectory of the current directory named <i>dir9</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>mv file10 dir9/file10</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Detailed information (including all options) about mv as well as all of 
the other commands discussed above can be obtained by using their <i>--help</i> option. Thus, for example, to obtain more information about the mv command, the following would be used:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>mv --help</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, information about the current version of each command can be obtained by using its <i>--version</i> option.
