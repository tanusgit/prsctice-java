<i>grep</i> is used to search text for patterns specified by the user. It is one of the most useful and powerful <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">commands</a> on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> and other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_system.html">operating systems</a>.
</p>

<p>
grep's basic syntax is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>grep [option(s)] pattern [file(s)]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The items in square brackets are optional. When used with no <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a> and no <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>arguments</i></a> (i.e., input <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filedef.html">files</a>), grep searches <a href="http://www.linfo.org/standard_input.html"><i>standard input</i></a> (which by default is text typed in at the keyboard) for the specified pattern and returns each <i>line</i> that contains a match to <a href="http://www.linfo.org/standard_output.html"><i>standard output</i></a> (which by default is the display screen).
</p>

<p>
A line of text is defined in this context not as what appears as a line 
of text on the display screen but rather as all text between two <i>newline</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/character.html">characters</a>. Newline characters are invisible characters that are represented in Unix-like operating systems by a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/backslash.html">backslash</a> followed by the letter <i>n</i> and which are created when a user presses the ENTER key when using a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/text_editor.html">text editor</a> (such as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gedit.html">gedit</a>). Thus, a line of text returned by grep can be as short as a single character or occupy many lines on the display screen.
</p>

<p>
grep can search any number of files simultaneously. Thus, for example, the following would search the three files <i>file1</i>, <i>file2</i> and <i>file3</i> for any line that contains the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/string.html"><i>string</i></a> (i.e., sequence of characters) <i>Lin</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>grep Lin file1 file2 file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Each result is displayed beginning on a separate line, and it is 
preceded by the name of the file in which it was found in the case of 
multiple files. The inclusion of the file names in the output data can 
be suppressed by using the <i>-h</i> option.
</p>

<p>
grep is not limited to searching for just single strings. It can also 
search for sequences of strings, including phrases. This is accomplished
 by enclosing the sequence of strings that forms the pattern in 
quotation marks (either single or double). Thus, the above example could
 be modified to search for the phrase <i>Linux is</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>grep 'Linux is' file1 file2 file3</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Text searches with grep can be considerably broadened by combining them with <a href="http://www.linfo.org/wildcard.html"><i>wildcards</i></a> and/or performing <i>recursive</i>
 searches. A wildcard is a character that can represent some specific 
class of characters or sequence of characters. The following is a 
modification of the above example that uses the <i>star wildcard</i> (i.e., an asterisk), which represents <i>any</i> character or sequence of characters, to search <i>all</i> text files in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html"><i>current directory</i></a> (i.e., the directory in which the user is currently working):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>grep 'Linux is' *</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
grep's search area can be broadened even further by using its <i>-r</i> option to search <i>recursively</i> through an entire <a href="http://www.linfo.org/directory_tree.html"><i>directory tree</i></a>
 (i.e., a directory and all levels of subdirectories within it) rather 
than just the files within a specified directory. For example, the 
following would search all files in the current directory and in all of 
its subdirectories (including their subdirectories, etc.) for every line
 containing the full name of the creator of Linux:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>grep -r 'Linus Torvalds' *</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One of the most commonly employed of grep's many options is <i>-i</i>, which instructs it to ignore <i>case</i>, that is, to ignore whether letters in the pattern and text searched are <a href="http://www.linfo.org/lower_case.html">lower case</a>
 (i.e., small letters) or upper case (i.e., capital letters). Thus, for 
instance, the previous example could very easily be converted to a 
case-insensitive search as follows: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>grep -ir 'Linus Torvalds' *</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This would produce the same results as
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>grep -ir 'linUS torvAlds' *</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another frequently used option is <i>-c</i>, which causes grep to only 
report the number of times that the pattern has been matched for each 
file and to not display the actual lines. Thus, for instance, the 
following would show the total number of times that the string <i>inu</i> appears in a file named <i>file4</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>grep -c inu file4</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another useful option is <i>-n</i>, which causes grep to precede each line of output with the number of the line in the text file from which it was obtained. The <i>-v</i> option inverts the match; that is, it matches only those lines that do <i>not</i> contain the given pattern. The <i>-w</i> option tells grep to select only those lines that contain an entire word or phrase that matches the specified pattern. The <i>-x</i> option tells grep to select only those lines that match exactly the specified pattern.
</p>

<p>
The <i>-l</i> option tells grep to not return the lines containing 
matches but to only return only the names of the files that contain 
matches. The <i>-L</i> option is the opposite of the <i>-l</i> option 
(and analogous to the -v option) in that it will cause grep to return 
only the names of files that do not contain the specified pattern.
</p>

<p>
grep does not search the names of files for a specified pattern, only 
the text contained within files. However, sometimes it is useful to 
search the names of files, as well as of directories and links, rather 
than the contents of files. Fortunately, this can easily be accomplished
 by first using the <i>ls</i> command to list the contents of a directory and then using a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pipe.html"><i>pipe</i></a>
 (which is represented by the vertical bar character) to transfer its 
output to grep for searching. For example, the following would provide a
 list of all files, directories and links in the current directory that 
contain the string <i>linu</i> in their names: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls | grep linu</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following example uses ls with its <i>-l</i> (i.e., <i>long</i>) option (which is unrelated to grep's <i>-l</i> option) to find all filesystem objects in the current directory whose <a href="http://www.linfo.org/permissions.html"><i>permissions</i></a> have been set so that any user can read, write and execute them:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>ls -l | grep rwxrwxrwx</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
grep is very useful for obtain information from log and configuration 
files. For example, it can be used to obtain information about the USB 
(universal serial bus) devices on a system by filtering the output from 
the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/dmesg.html"><i>dmesg</i></a> command (which provides the messages from the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/kernel.html">kernel</a> as a system is <a href="http://www.linfo.org/boot.html">booting up</a>) as follows: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>dmesg | grep -i usb</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Among grep's other options are <i>--help</i>, which provides a very compact summary of some of its many capabilities, and <i>-V</i>, or <i>--version</i>, which provides information about the currently installed version.  
</p>

<p>
grep's search functionality can be even further refined through the use of <i>regular expressions</i>.
 These are a pattern matching system that uses strings constructed 
according to pre-defined syntax rules to find desired patterns in text. 
Additional information about grep, including its use with regular 
expressions, can be obtained from its built-in manual page by using the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/man.html"><i>man</i></a> command, i.e.,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>man grep</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The name <i>grep</i> comes from a command in <i>ed</i>, which was the original text editor on the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix_upper.html">UNIX</a> operating system. The command takes the form <i>g/re/p</i>, which means to search <i>globally</i> for matches to the regular expression (i.e., <i>re</i>), and <i>print</i> (which is UNIX terminology for write on the display screen) lines that are found.
