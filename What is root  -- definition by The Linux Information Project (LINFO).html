<p>
<i>root</i> is the user name or account that by default has access to all <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">commands</a> and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/file.html">files</a> on a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> or other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_system.html">operating system</a>. It is also referred to as the <i>root account</i>, <i>root user</i> and the <i>superuser</i>.
</p>

<p>
The word <i>root</i> also has several additional, related meanings when 
used as part of other terms, and thus it can be a source of confusion to
 people new to Unix-like systems. 
</p>

<p>
One of these is the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root_directory.html"><i>root directory</i></a>, which is the <i>top level directory</i> on a system. That is, it is the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/directory.html">directory</a> in which all other directories, including their subdirectories, and files reside. The root directory is designated by a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/forward_slash.html">forward slash</a> ( / ). 
</p>

<p>
Another is <a href="http://www.linfo.org/slash_root.html"><i>/root</i></a> (pronounced <i>slash root</i>), which is the root user's <a href="http://www.linfo.org/home_directory.html"><i>home directory</i></a>.
 A home directory is the primary repository of a user's files, including
 that user's configuration files, and it is usually the directory in 
which a user finds itself when it <a href="http://www.linfo.org/login_def.html">logs into</a>
 a system. /root is a subdirectory of the root directory, as indicated 
by the forward slash that begins its name, and should not to be confused
 with that directory. Home directories for users other than root are by 
default created in the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/home.html"><i>/home</i></a> directory, which is another standard subdirectory of the root directory.   
</p>

<p>
<i>Root privileges</i> are the powers that the root account has on the 
system. The root account is the most privileged on the system and has 
absolute power over it (i.e., complete access to all files and 
commands). Among root's powers are the ability to modify the system in 
any way desired and to grant and revoke <a href="http://www.linfo.org/permissions.html"><i>access permissions</i></a>
 (i.e., the ability to read, modify and execute specific files and 
directories) for other users, including any of those that are by default
 reserved for root.  
</p>

<p>
A <a href="http://www.linfo.org/rootkit.html"><i>rootkit</i></a> is a set of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/software.html">software</a> tools secretly installed by an intruder into a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/computer.html">computer</a>
 that allows such intruder to use that computer for its own, usually 
nefarious, purposes when desired. Well designed rootkits are able to 
obtain <i>root access</i> (i.e., access to the root account rather than 
just to a user account) and to hide most or all traces of their presence
 and activities.   
</p>

<p>
The use of the term <i>root</i> for the all-powerful administrative user may have arisen from the fact that root is the only account having <i>write permissions</i> (i.e., permission to modify files) in the root directory. The root directory, in turn, takes its name from the fact that the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filesystem.html"><i>filesystems</i></a>
 (i.e., the entire hierarchy of directories that is used to organize 
files) in Unix-like operating systems have been designed with a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/directory_tree.html">tree-like</a>
 (although inverted) structure in which all directories branch off from a
 single directory that is analogous to the root of a tree. 
</p>

<p>
The original <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix_upper.html">UNIX</a> 
operating system, on which Linux and other Unix-like systems are based, 
was designed from the very beginning as a multi-user system because 
personal computers did not yet exist and each user was connected to the <i>mainframe</i> computer (i.e., a large, centralized computer) via a <i>dumb</i>
 (i.e., very simple) terminal. Thus it was necessary to have a mechanism
 for separating and protecting the files of the individual users while 
allowing them to use the system simultaneously. It was also necessary to
 have a means for enabling a system administrator to perform such tasks 
as entering user directories and files to correct individual problems, 
granting and revoking powers for ordinary users, and accessing critical 
system files to repair or upgrade the system. 
</p>

<p></p>
Every user account is automatically assigned an identification number, the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/uid.html">UID</a>
 (i.e., user ID), by a Unix-like system, and the system uses these 
numbers instead of the user names to identify and keep track of the 
users. Root always has a UID of zero. This can be verified by logging in
 as root (if using a home computer or other system that permits this 
operation) and running the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/echo.html"><i>echo</i></a> command to display the UID of the current user, i.e.,
<p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>echo $UID</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
echo is used to repeat on the screen what is typed in after it. The 
dollar sign preceding UID tells echo to display its value rather than 
its name.
</p>

<p>
The UID for root (as well as for all other users) can also be seen by looking at <a href="http://www.linfo.org/etc_passwd.html"><i>/etc/passwd</i></a>, which is the configuration file for user <a href="http://www.linfo.org/data.html">data</a>. This file can be viewed (by default by all users) by using the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/cat.html"><i>cat</i></a> command (which is commonly employed to read files), i.e., 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cat /etc/passwd | less </code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The output of <i>cat /etc/passwd</i> in this example is <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pipe.html"><i>piped</i></a> (i.e., transferred) to the <i>less</i>
 command to allow it to be read one screenful at a time, which is useful
 if the file is a long one. The line of output for root will look 
something like <i>root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash</i>. The first column shows the user name and the third column shows the UID, which can be seen to be zero.  
</p>

<p>
The permissions system in Unix-like operating systems is set by default 
to prevent access by ordinary users to critical parts of the system and 
to files and directories belonging to other users. Thus, it can be very 
tempting for users new to such systems, especially those who are 
accustomed to systems with a weak permissions system or without any 
permissions system (e.g., Microsoft Windows or the older versions of the
 Macintosh), to bypass this permissions system on their personal 
computers by logging directly into the root account and staying there. 
Although this provides momentary relief, it should be avoided and 
ordinary work on the system should be done via an ordinary user account.
</p>

<p>
This is because it is very easy to damage a Unix-like system when using 
it as root -- much easier than to damage most other types of operating 
systems. The designers of most other operating systems devised methods 
of protecting the system and data to compensate for the lack of a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/robust.html">robust</a> permissions system. 
</p>

<p>
However, an important principle of Unix-like operating systems is the 
provision of maximum flexibility to configure the system, and thus the 
root user is fully empowered. Unix-like systems assume that the system 
administrator knows exactly what he or she is doing and that only such 
individual(s) will be using the root account. Thus, there is virtually 
no safety net for the root user in the event of a careless error, such 
as damaging or deleting a critical system file (which could make the 
entire system inoperable). 
</p>

<p>
Adding to the danger of routinely using the system as root is the fact that all <a href="http://www.linfo.org/process.html"><i>processes</i></a> (i.e., <a href="http://www.linfo.org/instance.html">instances</a> of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">programs</a> in execution) started by the root user have root privileges. Because even the most widely used and well-tested <a href="http://www.linfo.org/appslist.html">application programs</a>
 contain numerous programming errors (due to the huge amount of code 
required and its great complexity), a skilled attacker can often find 
and exploit such an error to obtain control of a system when a program 
is run with root privileges rather than using an ordinary user account, 
with its very limited privileges. 
</p>

<p>
A critical means for preventing users from directly damaging Unix-like 
systems or increasing the vulnerability of such systems to damage by 
others is the avoidance of using the root account except when absolutely
 necessary, even by knowledgeable and experienced system administrators.
 That is, rather than routinely logging into the system as root, 
administrators should log in with their ordinary user accounts and then 
use commands, such as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/su.html"><i>su</i></a>, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/kdesu.html"><i>kdesu</i></a> and <i>sudo</i>, that provide them with root privileges only as needed and without requiring a new login.  
</p>

<p>
For example, to become root with su merely requires typing
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>su</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
at the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line.html"><i>command line</i></a>
 (i.e., in the all-text mode), pressing the Enter key and supplying the 
root password. The account of the previous user can be returned to by 
pressing the Ctrl and <i>d</i> keys simultaneously or by typing the word <i>exit</i> and then pressing the Enter key.
</p>

<p>
The security associated with using su can be increased by using its <i>-c</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">option</a>,
 which terminates it and causes an immediate return to the former user 
account after the current command has completed execution or after any 
program that it has launched has been closed.
</p>

<p>
Tasks that require root privileges include moving files or directories into or out of <i>system directories</i>
 (i.e., directories that are critical to the functioning of the 
operating system), copying files into system directories, granting or 
revoking user privileges, some system repairs, and the installation of 
some application programs. By default, it is not necessary to be root to
 be able to read most configuration files and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/documentation.html">documentation</a> files in system directories, although it is necessary to be root to modify them. 
</p>

<p>
Root privileges are usually required for installing software in RPM (Red
 Hat Package Manager) package format because of the need to write to 
system directories. If an application program is being <i>compiled</i> (i.e., converted into runnable form) from <a href="http://www.linfo.org/source_code.html"><i>source code</i></a>
 (i.e., its original, human-readable form), however, it can usually be 
configured to install and run from a user's home directory. Root 
privileges are not needed by an ordinary user to compile and install 
software in its home directory. Compiling software as root should be 
avoided for security reasons.
</p>

<p>
On large systems used by businesses and other organizations, there will 
likely be several system administrators. Each will have its own account 
in which it will ordinarily work (and the activities of which will be 
automatically recorded in system logs for security and repair purposes) 
but will also have access to the root account for use when necessary. 
The system administrator(s) might grant limited root privileges to some 
individuals, such as assistant administrators.
