<p>
There are a number of  "clones" of the vi editor. This term refers to 
programs with a similar appearance and functions but which were written 
from scratch with completely new source code.
</p>

<p>
The vi clones were written because the source code for the original 
version was not freely available until recently. This made it impossible
 to extend the functionality of vi. It also precluded porting vi to 
other operating systems, including Linux.
</p>

<p>
The list of vi clones includes calvin, elvis, elwin, lemmy, nvi, stevie,
 vile, viper and Vim. Vim is possibly the most popular, and  it is 
included in Red Hat Linux and many other distributions. nvi is  the 
"official" Berkeley clone of vi, and it is included in FreeBSD and the 
other BSD variants. 
</p>

<p>
calvin is a freeware "partial clone of vi" for use on MS-DOS. It has the
 advantages of small size (the .exe file is only 46.1KB!) and fast 
execution but the
disadvantage that it lacks many of the ex commands, such as
search and replace. </p>

<p>lemmy is a shareware version of  vi implemented for the Microsoft 
Windows platforms  which combines the interface of vi with the look and 
feel of a Windows application. </p>
<p></p>



<p>The clones add numerous new features which make them significantly 
easier to use than the original vi, especially for neophytes. A 
particularly useful feature in many of them is the ability to edit files
 in multiple windows. This facilitates working on more than one file at 
the same time, including cutting and pasting text among them.
</p>

<p>
Many of the clones also offer GUI versions of vi that operate under the X
 Windows system and can take advantage of bit-mapped (high resolution) 
displays and the mouse. 
</p>


<p>
Additional features in the clones that make editing easier and more 
powerful include (1) the ability to edit ex commands as they are typed, 
(2) command completion, (3) unlimited line length,  (4) the ability to 
let long lines trail off the edge of screen instead of wrapping,  (5) 
the ability to search for text while typing the search pattern, (6) 
visible indication of the mode (i.e., insert or command), (7) indicators
 for the current line and column, (8) a recallable command history, ((9)
 the ability to edit binary and/or executable files and (10) infinite 
levels of undo. 
</p>

<p>
Despite the many added features of the clones, there are some important 
reasons to first become proficient in the original vi. One is that the 
core commands in the original version are also used in all of the 
clones. Thus by learning vi, you are also learning the most important 
part of the clones, and it should then be easy to use any clone 
productively. 
</p>

<p>
Another is that there may be situations in which the original version of
 vi is the only editor available. For example, you may be dealing with 
an older Linux installation which only uses the original version or with
 an ultra-compact Linux installation (such as one that resides in an 
embedded system or on a single-floppy disk) where there is no room for 
clones because of their larger memory requirements.
