<p>
The <i>pwd</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> reports the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/absolute_pathname.html"><i>full path</i></a> to the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/current_directory.html"><i>current directory</i></a>.
</p>

<p> 
The current directory is the directory in which a user is currently operating while using a <i>command line interface</i>. A command line interface is an all-text display mode and it is provided via a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/console.html"><i>console</i></a> (i.e., a display mode in which the entire screen is text only) or via a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/terminal_window.html"><i>terminal window</i></a> (i.e., a text-only <a href="http://www.linfo.org/window.html">window</a> in a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gui.html">GUI</a>).  
</p>

<p> 
The full path, also called an <i>absolute path</i>, to a directory or file is the complete hierarchy of directories from the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root_directory.html"><i>root directory</i></a>
 to and including that directory or file. The root directory, which is 
designated by a forward slash (/), is the base directory on the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filesystem.html"><i>filesystem</i></a>
 (i.e., hierarchy of directories), and it contains all other 
directories, subdirectories and files on the system. Thus, the full path
 for any directory or file always begins with a forward slash.
</p>

<p> 
pwd is one of the most basic commands in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> and other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating systems</a>, along with <i>ls</i>, which is used to list the contents of the current directory, and <i>cd</i>, which is used to change the current directory.
</p>

<p>
pwd's syntax is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>pwd [option]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike most commands, pwd is almost always used just by itself, i.e., 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>pwd</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is, it is rarely used with its <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a> and never used with <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>arguments</i></a>
 (i.e., file names or other information provided as inputs). Anything 
that is typed on the same line after pwd, with the exception of an 
option, is ignored, and no error messages are returned. 
</p>

<p>
As an example, if a user with the username <i>janis</i> is in its home directory, then the above command would typically return <i>/home/janis/</i> (because, by default, all home directories are located in the directory <a href="http://www.linfo.org/home.html"><i>/home</i></a>). Likewise, if a user were currently working in directory <i>/usr/share/config</i> (which contains a number of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">program</a> configuration files), then the same command would return <i>/usr/share/config</i>.
</p>

<p>
pwd is useful for confirming that the current directory has actually 
been changed to what the user intended after using cd. For example, 
after issuing the cd command to change the current directory from 
/home/janis to /usr/share/config, pwd could be used for confirmation; 
that is, the following sequence of commands would be issued:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cd /usr/share/config/</code></p><p>
<code>pwd</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p> 
The standard version of pwd has a mere two options, both of which are employed only infrequently. The <i>--help</i> option is used as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>pwd --help</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p> 
This option displays information about pwd, of which there is very 
little because it is such a simple command (i.e., it only has two 
options and accepts no arguments).
</p>

<p>
The other option is <i>--version</i>, which displays the version number, i.e., 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>pwd --version</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although it is often thought of as standing for <i>present working directory</i>, <i>pwd</i> is actually an <a href="http://www.linfo.org/acronym_list.html">acronym</a> for <i>print working directory</i>. The word <i>print</i> is traditional <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix_upper.html">UNIX</a> terminology for <i>write</i> or <i>display</i>,
 and it originated when computer output was typically printed on paper 
by default because CRT (cathode ray tube) display monitors were not yet 
widely available.
</p>
Despite its extreme simplicity, pwd remains one of the most useful and 
popular of the commands for Unix-like operating systems. Actually, this 
simplicity is completely consistent with the Unix philosophy, which 
emphasizes small, specialized and modular programs rather than the large
 and complex programs that are favored by some other operating systems.
