The <i>clear</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is used to remove all previous commands and output from <a href="http://www.linfo.org/console.html"><i>consoles</i></a> and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/terminal_window.html"><i>terminal windows</i></a> in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating systems</a>.  
</p>

<p>
A console is an all-text mode user interface that occupies the entire 
screen of the display device and which does not sit on top of a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gui.html">graphical user interface</a> (GUI). A terminal window is a text-only <a href="http://www.linfo.org/window.html">window</a> in a GUI that emulates a console and which can be opened by clicking the appropriate <a href="http://www.linfo.org/icon.html"><i>icon</i></a> (i.e., small image) or menu item.
</p>

<p>
Clear is one of the very few commands in Unix-like operating systems that accepts neither options nor <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>arguments</i></a> (i.e., input files). That is, it is only used as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>clear</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
After the clear command has been issued, all that remains on the display screen is the <i>command prompt</i> in the upper left hand corner. A command prompt, also referred to as a <i>prompt</i>,
 is a short text message at the start of a line that informs the user 
that the system is ready for the next command, data element or other 
input. 
</p>

<p>
Removing previous commands and output can make it easier for users to 
focus on and understand subsequent commands and their output. It can 
also be useful in preventing the next user on a system from seeing what 
the previous user did. 
</p>

<p>
clear first looks in the <i>environment</i> (i.e., a set of variables 
that tells how to run the system) to find the type of terminal that is 
being used, and then it looks in the <i>terminfo</i> database to 
determine how to empty the screen of all but the command prompt on a 
single line. The terminfo database describes the all-text mode terminals
 on the system by giving a set of their capabilities, specifying how to 
perform screen operations and specifying initialization sequences and 
padding requirements.
</p>

<p>
In Unix-like operating systems there are often multiple ways of 
performing the same task. For example, the same result as using the 
clear command can be achieved in the <i>bash</i> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/shell.html"><i>shell</i></a> by simultaneously pressing the CONTROL and <i>l</i> (<a href="http://www.linfo.org/lower_case.html">lower case</a>
 L) keys. A shell is a program that provides the traditional, text-only 
user interface in consoles and terminal windows, and bash is the default
 shell on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The bash shell also allows a single line to be cleared by simultaneously pressing the CONTROL and <i>7</i> (number seven) keys. In addition, everything except the current line can be removed by simultaneously pressing the CONTROL and <i>L</i> (upper case L) keys.
