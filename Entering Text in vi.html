<p>vi has two basic  modes of operation: command mode and text insert 
mode. How to switch back and forth between them is probably the most 
confusing thing about vi for beginners. But it is actually very simple, 
and once you get used to it you might also find it quite efficient.

</p>

<p>
Command mode is the default mode when a file (existing or new) is 
opened. (This is the opposite of most text and word processors and 
therefore may seem counter-intuitive.) Because every file opens 
initially in command mode, you can not immediately begin typing text. 
That is, everything that is typed on the keyboard is interpreted by vi 
to be a command. 
</p>

<p>


</p>

<p>Examples of the many types of commands that you can perform on a file
 while in command mode are (1) switching to text insert mode,  (2) 
moving the cursor around the file, (3) deleting characters or lines, (4)
 transposing characters, (6) changing case, (6) appending the contents 
of the file to another (closed) file, (7) setting vi options, (8) saving
 the file to disk and (9) closing the file and quitting vi.</p>

<p>
The other mode, text insert mode, is also referred to as simply "insert 
mode" or "input mode." It is used for entering text  into the buffer 
memory (and simultaneously onto the screen). In this mode everything 
that is typed on the keyboard is added to the text and does not become a
 command (although you can perform some command operations in text mode 
with vi clones).</p>

<p> The most common way to switch from command mode to the input mode is to use the <b>i</b>  (which stands for "insert" or "input") command. This is accomplished by simply typing the letter <code>i</code> while in command mode. Now you are ready to start typing text.</p>


<p>Unlike word processors and even most word editors, there is no 
automatic word wrap in the traditional version of vi (although you will 
notice it in some clones). New lines are started by pressing ENTER.</p>


<p>When you are finished typing text or you want to perform some other 
operation such as moving to a different position in the text or deleting
 some of it, hit ESC in order to return to the command mode.</p>

<p>It is not easy to determine vi's current mode. But  this is not 
really a problem because, if in doubt, just press ESC and you will know 
that you are in the command mode (this will put you in command mode if 
you were not already in it).</p>

<p>Once you have typed some text, you can use the four basic commands 
for moving the cursor around the text. These commands enable you to go 
to any desired location in order to modify the text, including making 
insertions and deletions.
The four basic cursor positioning commands are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>h</b>    &nbsp;&nbsp; move cursor one character to left
<br><b>j</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; move cursor one line down
<br><b>k</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; move cursor one line up
<br><b>l</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; move cursor one character to right</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Each of these commands can be either used by itself or  modified by 
typing an integer in front of it to indicate the number of characters or
 lines to move. For example, typing (in command mode, of course) </p>


<blockquote>
<p>
<code>3j</code>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>will move the cursor  down three lines. Or typing <code>2h</code> will move it two characters to the left.
 </p>


<p>These commands can be repeated by holding the key down. If you attempt an impossible movement, such as pressing <code>k</code>
 when the cursor is on the top line, the screen might flash or a beeping
 sound might be made (depending on how your computer is set up). </p>


<p>
The cursor can be moved directly to any desired line by using the <b>G</b> command preceded by the line number. For example, typing</p>



<blockquote>
<p>
<code>5G</code>
</p>
</blockquote>




<p>moves the cursor to the fifth line from the top of the text. Just typing <code>G</code> without any number moves the cursor to the final line of text.


</p>

<p> When you switch from command mode to input mode with the <b>i</b> 
command and then start typing text, each character you type is placed to
 the left of the character covered by the cursor. This causes the 
character covered by the cursor as well as everything to its right to be
 shifted  to the right. 
</p>

<p>
There will be times when you will want to place a character to the right
 of the character under the cursor. This is particularly useful when the
 cursor is over the last character in a line and you want to append the 
line. To do this, simply use the <b>a</b> (lower case "a," which stands for "append") command instead of the <b>i</b> command to switch from command mode into insert mode.
</p>



<p>After you have saved a file that you have created or modified using 
vi, you might want to verify that its contents are really what you had 
intended. One way to do this is to use <i>cat</i>, the Unix 
concatenation utility.  (No, this has no relationship to the popular 
domesticated animal whose name has the same spelling). For example, 
type:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cat /home/john/fruit/lemon</code>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This causes the contents of the file "lemon" in the /home/john/fruit/
 directory to be displayed on the screen in a read-only form.</p>

<p>Of course, if your current directory is already /home/john/fruit/, then you only need to type:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>cat lemon</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
