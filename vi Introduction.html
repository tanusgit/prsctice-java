<p>"vi" (pronounced "vee eye") is a text editor with a deceptively 
simple appearance that belies its great power and efficiency. New users 
soon realize that there is far more to this little program than meets 
the eye.
</p>

<p>
vi, or one of its clones, is found in almost every version of Linux and Unix, and, in fact, it is the <i>only</i>
 editor that is available in virtually every Unix installation. 
Moreover, clones of vi are available for nearly every other operating 
system in use today, including Microsoft Windows. This makes  it one of 
the most widely available programs in the world! 
</p>



<p>
This near-ubiquity plus its power and efficiency (at least for 
experienced users) makes vi  one of the most important programs for 
students of Linux to learn. And a command of vi helps  differentiate a 
beginner from a true power user of Linux or Unix.
