<i>pstree</i> is a small, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line.html"><i>command line</i></a> (i.e., all-text mode) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html">program</a> that displays the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/process.html"><i>processes</i></a> (i.e., executing instances of programs) on the system in the form of a <i>tree diagram</i>. It differs from the much more commonly used (and more complex) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/ps.html"><i>ps</i></a>
 program in a number of respects, including that the latter shows the 
processes in a list rather than a tree diagram but provides more 
detailed information about them.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Tree Diagrams</strong>
</p>

<p> 
A tree diagram is a way of showing the <i>ancestral</i> relationships 
among processes (or other entities) by connecting them with short lines 
that indicate for each process the process from which it originated 
(i.e., its  <i>parent</i>) and any processes that it created (i.e., its <i>children</i>). This type of diagram differs from the usual image of a tree in that the root is at the top and the branches point downwards.
</p>

<p> 
Similar inverted tree diagrams are commonly used to illustrate the hierarchical <a href="http://www.linfo.org/filesystem.html">filesystems</a> of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> and other <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating systems</a>, which begin with the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root_directory.html"><i>root directory</i></a> (represented by a forward slash) off from which branch the second tier directories such as <a href="http://www.linfo.org/bin.html">/bin</a>, /boot, /etc, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/home.html">/home</a>, /mount and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/sbin.html">/sbin</a>. 
</p>

<p>
One of the advantages of pstree as compared with ps is that it makes it 
easier to  terminate a series of related processes (i.e., all of the 
descendants of a particular process). This is because pstree makes it 
immediately clear which process is the parent, and all that is necessary
 is to terminate the parent in order to extinguish all of its descendant
 processes. That is, it is not necessary to manually search through a 
list to find and individually terminate each process as would be 
necessary using ps. The <a href="http://www.linfo.org/kill.html"><i>kill</i></a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> is commonly used to terminate a crashed or otherwise misbehaving program or process.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Syntax</strong>
</p>

<p> 
The basic syntax for pstree is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>pstree [options] [pid or username]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The square brackets indicate that the items in them are optional. If pstree is used without any <a href="http://www.linfo.org/option.html">options</a> or <a href="http://www.linfo.org/argument.html"><i>arguments</i></a>, that is, by typing 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>pstree</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and then pressing the ENTER key, the result is a tree diagram that shows all of the processes currently on the system.
</p>

<p> 
At the very top of the diagram is the process <i>init</i>. This is because init is always the first process that is started when Linux is <i>booted up</i>
 (i.e., started up). It is the ancestor of all other processes, and it 
remains on the system for the duration of the session. It can be seen 
that pstree itself is also listed as a process, as is everything on the 
system.
</p>

<p>
The processes that are directly connected to the main stem (i.e., a 
vertical line extending downward from init along the left hand edge of 
the screen) of the tree are listed by default in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/alphabet.html">alphabet</a>ic order. This is in contrast to ps, which by default lists the processes in the sequence in which they were created. 
</p>

<p>
In order to economize on screen space and thus make its output easier to
 read, pstree  visually  merges  identical  branches by placing them in 
square brackets and prefixing them with an integer indicating the 
original number of branches. For example, four identical branches of <i>nautilus</i> representing four instances of this program would be compacted into a single branch labeled <i>-4*[nautilus]</i>
 rather than being shown as four separate branches. (Nautilus is the 
official file manager for the GNOME desktop, which is used on Red Hat 
and many other distributions of Linux.)
</p>

<p>
Because the tree diagram is generally long even with compaction and can 
easily require more vertical space than is available on a single screen,
 it can be convenient to use it together with the <i>less</i> command, i.e.,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>pstree | less</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This allows the output to be viewed one screenful at a time. The output 
can be advanced by pressing the space bar, and previous screens can be 
returned to by pressing the <i>b</i> key.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Options</strong>
</p>

<p> 
As is the case with most command line programs, pstree has several 
options that greatly enhance its flexibility and usefulness. One of the 
most commonly used is <i>-p</i>, which tells it to show <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pid.html"><i>process identification numbers</i></a>
 (PIDs). A PID is a unique, identifying, non-negative integer that is 
automatically assigned to each process on a Unix-like operating system. 
The command
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>pstree -p</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
will tell pstree to show a PID in parenthesis after each process name. ps, in contrast to pstree, shows PIDs by default. 
</p>

<p>
The -p option has a side effect of disabling compaction. This is because
 compaction occurs only for lines of output that are identical. Lines 
that are identical when no PIDs are shown are no longer identical when 
the PIDs are shown because each  instance of a program (and thus each 
line) has a different PID. An alternative is to use the <i>-c</i> option, whose sole purpose is to disable compaction.
</p>

<p>
The <i>-n</i> option instructs pstree to sort its output in the order of
 the PIDs instead of in the default alphabetic order. This can be seen 
most clearly when using it together with the -p option, i.e., 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>pstree -np | less</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p> 
The <i>-h</i> option highlights (or shows in bold) the current process 
and all of its ancestors, if highlighting is permitted by the particular
 system. For example, on a Red Hat 9 system, this option results in 
something such as 
<i>gnome-terminal-bash-pstree</i> as well as <i>init</i> (because it is the ancestor of all processes) being shown in bold characters. 
</p>

<p> 
The <i>-u</i> option tells pstree to show the <i>owner</i> of a process 
(i.e., the user that started it) in parenthesis whenever its ownership 
differs from that of its parent. This makes it a simple matter to 
determine who is the owner of any process. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>-l</i> option prevents the truncation of long lines of output 
that can occur when the display screen is not sufficiently wide. It does
 this by <i>wrapping</i> (i.e., carrying over) any excess output to the next line.
</p>

<p>
The <i>-a</i> option  shows the command line arguments for each process 
that was initiated by a user (instead of by another process) by issuing a
 command with arguments. As is the case with the -p option, this option 
also automatically disables compaction.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Arguments</strong>
</p>

<p>
An argument, also called a <i>command line argument</i>, is a file name 
or other information that is provided to a command in order for that 
command to use it as an input. pstree can accept a maximum of one 
argument, and that argument can be either the name of a user or a PID. 
</p>

<p>
Providing pstree with an argument causes it to show only parts of the 
process tree rather than the entire tree. If a user name is specified, 
only the branches that start at processes owned by that user are shown. 
If a PID is provided, only the branch that begins with that process is 
shown. 
</p>


<p>
For example, the following command will show only those branches that have been initiated by a user with a username <i>joe</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>pstree joe</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It can be seen that the main stem (i.e., the vertical stem) is not shown
 when the name of an ordinary user is provided as an argument. However, 
the main stem is shown if the argument is the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/root.html"><i>root user</i></a> (i.e., administrative user), as can be seen by entering the following: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>pstree root</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The reason is that init is owned by the root user (which can be verified by using the <i>ps -aux</i> command).
