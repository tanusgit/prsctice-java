A careful study of the preceding material is sufficient for you to be 
well on your way to becoming proficient at vi. All you really need to do
 now is continue to practice what you have learned. The following 
material is presented for those of you who want to learn just a few more
 useful commands.
</p>



<p>As you have learned, creating and opening files in vi can be a very 
simple matter. However, many combinations of options are available that 
can add much power and flexibility for these tasks, as can be seen by 
looking at the full syntax for opening files:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>vi [flags] [cmd] [filename]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The square brackets ([ ]) around each section of arguments 
(modifiers) of the command indicates that they are optional. (That is, a
 file can be opened by just typing <code>vi</code> alone or by typing it with any combination of the three arguments. For instance, the example of <code>vi dog</code> contains only the mandatory <code>vi</code> and the optional third argument, which is the name of the file to open.)
</p>



<p>As only one of many possible examples of adding options for opening 
files, an existing file can be opened with the cursor appearing on any 
desired line instead of just on the first line. (One situation in which 
this can be particularly useful is if your file is part of a program 
which you are writing and the compiler reports an error on a specific 
line in that file.) This is accomplished by adding the <b>+</b> (plus 
sign) command followed the desired line number. For example, to open the
 file "apple" with the cursor located on the third line, type:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<code>vi +3 apple</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Use of the <b>+</b> command without any modifying number opens a file 
with the cursor positioned on the last line of text. This can save some 
keystrokes when you want to open a file just to append data to the end 
of it. For example:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<code>vi + apple</code>
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You have already learned several commands for switching from  command mode to insert mode, including <b>i</b> for inserting to the left of the cursor position, <b>a</b> for inserting to the right of the cursor position and the <b>c</b> commands for changing text. A more complete list  is as follows:
</p>

<table cellpadding="5" border="0"><tbody><tr width="100%"><td width="30"></td><td width="30"><b>  a </b></td><td> appends after current cursor position </td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td><b> A </b></td><td> appends at end of current line  </td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td><b> c </b></td><td> starts a change option  </td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td><b> C </b></td><td>  starts a change option from current position to end of current line </td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td><b> i </b></td><td>  inserts to the left of the cursor position </td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td><b> I </b></td><td>  inserts at start of line </td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td><b> o </b></td><td>     cursor moves to new, blank line below its current position 

  </td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td><b> O </b></td><td>  cursor moves to new, blank line above its current position </td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td><b> R </b></td><td>  replaces characters one at a time</td></tr>


</tbody></table>

<p></p>


A simple way to obtain basic information about any file that is 
currently open, including name, size and the current line number, is to 
hold down CTRL and type <code>g</code>. This data appears on the bottom line of the display.
